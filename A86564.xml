            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>Joh. 1.4, 5.</hi>
               </note> For verily <hi>Adam</hi> forfeited for himſelf and us, what ever might evidence goodneſs towards us, even life it ſelf, and all other mercies thereof, ſo as had God dealt with us after the demerit of his ſin, nothing but wrath and miſery had been upon us. But verily Chriſt ſtepping in, upholds all things, and makes them conſiſt and ſtand together for our uſe and ſervice. Yea, there-through alſo have we in theſe latter days, that which is yet more precious, the Publiſhing of the Word and Goſpel of God, ordered unto all Nations the end and tendency of all, which too is to lead us to repentance, that repenting of our evils againſt one ſo good to us, he might ſhew us greater things ſtill, even the bleſſings of a better life, prepared and made ready in Chriſt Jeſus for us, pardon, and peace, and ſpirit, and eternal happineſs. And ſurely the gift of Chriſt, and his death and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings for us, muſt needs it ſelf be an ineſtimable favour, and deſerve at our hands unutterable thanks, which is the way and inlet, yea, in a maner, the onely procuring cauſe under the good Will of God of all theſe mercies. How then are men in generall bound unto thankefulneſs, but eſpecially we in this Nation, that enjoy the Scriptures, and publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel therein, which many other Nations have wickedly put away from themſelves and their poſterities? their ſupream powers yielding up themſelves to the power of darkneſs, and neither imbracing
<pb facs="tcp:117749:3"/>the Word of Truth themſelves, nor permitting it to others. Yea, what cauſe of thanks have we to God, that hath broken yokes of Tyranny and Oppreſſion from off us, that formerly hindered mens receit, and free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of his goodneſs? What ſalvations hath God wrought for us in the midſt of this earth? What plots hath he diſcovered? What deſigns of the enemies of Sion hath he defeated? How hath he guided Counſels, and ſtrengthened Armies to deliver us from the Power and Oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thoſe who being ingrateful to God themſelves for his goodneſs, could not indure that others ſhould acknowledge it aright, and be truly thankeful? And, O that we alſo after ſuch an addition of favors above what all have in common, may not run into that horrid ſin of unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, nor reject the tidings of his great goodneſs, and by obſerving lying vanities, forſake our own mercies, much leſs abuſe and turn it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to wantonneſs.

Againſt which their evil Doctrine I have written this inſuing Treatiſe, in which I have indeavoured to remove that froth of wit, and humane reaſon, and high thoughts of error, which are with ſo great noiſe of Orthodoxneſs (equivalent to the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> cry of Catholike) lifted up againſt the Apoſtles Doctrine: and to ſhew that God is good, really good to All, but eſpecially to thoſe that his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs makes good, and thankefully through faith to live unto him.

            <head>A Brief Reviſe of ſome few Paſſages.</head>
            <p>THere is a paſſage, good Reader, in the Epiſtle to the Reader, <hi>Pag.</hi> 14. <hi>viz.</hi> where I ſay, That none, till brought into Chriſt, can make any profitable uſe of, or rightly underſtand the Doctrines of Election and Reprobation, of which I deſire thy candid and favourable conſtruction, as ſpoken of (as they are moſt uſually looked upon) as ſecret Decrees and Counſels of God about the future eſtates of men, and not as acts or executions of decrees paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon men in time: for indeed in this latter ſenſe the Scripture (and we anſwerably may) doth ſpeak of them more intelligibly and profitably. As when it ſays, <hi>The Lord hath ſet apart for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the man that is godly, Pſal.</hi> 4.3. Such a chuſing, or ſetting apart for himſelf as is there ſpoken of, is, and may be profitably pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded as an inducement unto godlineſs: Alſo when its ſaid, That God, for ſuch wilfull refuſings of him, and his Word, Truth, and Grace, caſt off, reprobated or gave over ſuch and ſuch men, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.9, 10, 11, 14. <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.16, 30. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.28. Such a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding of Reprobation may both be apprehended, and good uſe may be made of it to, and by men yet unrenewed, to deter them from their obſtinacy in evill, and warn them to give diligent heed to God, leſt they ſhould be ſo dealt with; but in ſuch a maner of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, and propounding theſe things, I would not be underſtood there, but as under thoſe tearms men underſtand hidden, abſtruſe acts of the Counſell and Will of God in himſelf from everlaſting.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Pag.</hi> 21. of the ſame Epiſtle, there is <hi>lapſus memoriae;</hi> a miſtake of <hi>Hubberdine</hi> for Dr. <hi>Buckneham,</hi> through the defect of my memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, I not then having the Martyrology by me.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Pag.</hi> 74. <hi>lin.</hi> 15, 16, 17, &amp;c. ſome interlined paſſages of Mr. <hi>Owens</hi> Inferences were miſtaken, and miſplaced by the Printer. It ſhould have been printed thus, All that Chriſt dyed for: 1. He gives (that is, compels) to believe (an inference wholly groundleſs from that Text, it ſpeaking of actuall believers, and not of faith, as a thing yet to be given them.) 2. All that he dyed for, he juſtifies, makes righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and brings them to glory. 3. All he dyed for, he makes Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for, for collating on them all the choiſe benefits of his death.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Pag.</hi> 75. Where I ſay, The aſcribing an antecedent will, Whoſe fulfilling depends on any free contingent act of ours, fals not upon us; my meaning is, it fals not upon what I ſaid in the beginning of
<pb facs="tcp:117749:5"/>that Chapter, about Impretration and Application: That that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, viz. <hi>But I conceive, &amp;c.</hi> ſhould have been <hi>(yet I conceive that without injury to God, that may be called an Antecedent will, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects ſome Antecedent condition in us, in reſpect of ſome will of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting us as its proper object in a conſequent condition)</hi> in which I hope the ingenuous Reader will conceive that I ſpeak of the Actings or determinations of Gods will, which are called ſometime <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>What I ſay in <hi>Pag.</hi> 58. About Chriſts meriting his own exaltation in the humane nature, is ſo clear, that I hope none will deny it; and yet I find that <hi>Zanchy</hi> was ſomewhat queſtioned about it by ſome in his time; the learned Reader may ſee his defence of himſelf, and his confirmation of the Orthodoxneſs of that aſſertion, by the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of divers of the Ancient Fathers, as <hi>Auguſtine, Jerome, Ambroſe, Beda, &amp;c. in Epiſt ad Lectorem, tractatui de Fide Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianâ (five Confeſſioni ſuae) praefixâ;</hi> amongſt the reſt, that of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> is curt and pithy, <hi>in Phil.</hi> 2.10. Wherefore God hath high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exalted him. <hi>Humilitas claritatis meritum, olaritas humilitireis praemium ſed hoc factum eſt in formâ ſervi,</hi> &amp;c. And by <hi>Humility</hi> he <hi>merited</hi> his <hi>glory,</hi> and his <hi>glory</hi> was the <hi>reward</hi> of his <hi>humility,</hi> but this was not in the form of God, but in the form of a ſervant, or as he was made man, <hi>&amp;c.

It pleads for a truth, a part of that Doctrine of truth, which the Apoſtle and Teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth, both inſtructed our Fathers in,

<pb facs="tcp:117749:6"/>beginning the way of Chriſt hath been) every where ill ſpoken of, and exploded as little better then blaſphemy. Such force hath Satan, (Gods and mans adverſary) in the hearts of many, that they love not, nor believe that that ſpeaks good of God to them, and that which might do them good. But marvel not at that, good Reader, for this beam of truth findes no worſe entertainment herein then the body of Truth it ſelf, then the word of God made fleſh and manifeſted in the fleſh met with in the dayes of his fleſh. Came not He from the boſome of the Father to open his name unto men, and to ſhew to them the way of their ſalvation? was not he truly Jeſus, the ſalvation of God, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the world? one that came to teach men the knowledg of God, and lead them unto life? But O what courſe uſage did He finde? Did not the world abominate him, as if he had been a Devil incarnate, filled with Satan, the great deceiver of mankinde, leading them to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction! how often did they cry out againſt him, and offer to lay violent hands upon him, as if he was unworthy to live amongst them? What evil laws enacted they againſt him, caſting out of their Synagogues (meetings and fellowſhips) thoſe that would own him? Did they not call a councel about him and condemn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> him, therein and crave, yea al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt force it upon the Secular power, to deliver him up to be crucified by them, till they got their wills in that matter on him? how did they after his condemnation all-to revile, mock and taunt him, yea diſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully intreat and kill him? And as if they would leave no ſtone unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved for effecting their deſignes upon him, they ſeal him up in his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher, and ſet a guard to keep him therein. And who I pray were the perſons that thus uſed him? Were they not the generality of the people, but principally the Prieſts and Rulers, the zealous and devout, the ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming godly party, that were ſo ſtrict for tithing mint and rue, for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sabbaths, keeping out errors and blaſphemies, as that a man that judged by the outſide, would have ſworn they were the holieſt people and beſt beloved of God, that the world contained. The wiſe, the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the powerful, the Scribes, Phariſes, and Rulers of the people? But I pray was Chriſt leſs the Son of God or the great Truth of truths, becauſe he found ſo bad entertainment by theſe prudent zealots? becauſe they condemned him and put him to Death, was he therefore really guilty of that deceit and blasphemy with which they charged him? was it not indeed (as himſelf told them) becauſe he ſpake the truth to them, and they could not endure to hear it from him? Becauſe he teſtified of them that their deeds were evil, and their doctrine viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb facs="tcp:117749:6"/>which they ſet ſo high a price upon? many good deeds have I done (ſaith He) for which of them do ye ſtone me? And truly, friend, ſo have men dealt with this truth in hand, Its cryed out upon as a Doctrine of Satan, as error and blaſphemy, as the moſt pernicious Doctrine that can be taught almoſt, they ſit upon it in councel and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it, they have reviled it, railed on it, mocked, taunted it, yea have they not crucified it and almoſt killed it, and all this too hath been acted by the Learned. Prudent, Rabbies, Scribes and Rulers, but what evil hath it done? Why, diſturb the Churches peace? ſo they ſaid Chriſt and the Goſpel did their Synagogues. Deprives believers of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort? nay tis but them that believe it not (as Chriſt did them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not in him) not any right believers, as we ſhall ſhew, they can prove it guilty of no evil, and therefore let not their charges of it move thee, <hi>Veritas magna eſt &amp; praevalebit:</hi> let them bury it, and ſet a guard upon it, baniſh it their cities, countries, kingdomes, ſtrike hands with Satan himſelf, and combine with the gates and powers of hell to under it; out it will and ſhall, and ſhall be received. As <hi>Moſes</hi> lift up the Serpent in the wilderneſs, ſo ſhall the ſon of man be lifted up, that whoſoever believeth in him may not periſh but have eternal life. For truth is truth though hated and reproached; its cauſe is juſt, their accuſations groundleſs, their oppoſite poſitions Antichriſtian, but it ſelf divine, no nicety or fancy, but of great concernment, it being a truth that glorifies God and brings good news or tidings to men: which with thy patience, I ſhall a little demonſtrate, with the differences of their Anti-poſition of Chriſts dying only for an elect number in theſe following particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> Its a doctrine that gives glory to God, and magnifies his mercy or goodneſs and juſtice toward the ſons of men in his dealings with them, whereas the opinion it oppoſeth detracts from his glory in thoſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. Firſt, I ſay it commends and magnifies the goodneſs of God in the exerciſe of his mercy, while it ſpeaks of him as love it ſelf; one that is good, and therefore doth good, good to All, a lover and Saviour of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, and of the world in general; one that delights not in the death of the wicked, nor would that any ſhould periſh and run themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to deſtruction, but rather come to repentance and live; to which end it ſhewes that he hath provided a means for baniſhed mankinde to be brought back by to him again from that eſtate of miſery unto which they were baniſhed, yea that to that end he enlightens, manifeſts his truth, calls to look to him, lades with benefits, waytes with patience up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſinners, chaſtens them in mercy, to keep their ſouls from the pit, and
<pb facs="tcp:117749:7"/>to inlighten them with the light of the living: and all this not bounded up to a few, the far fewer part of men, but in ſome degree or other inlarged generally to all. And is not this a commendation of him as good and loving? is it not the nature of love to diffuſe it ſelf abroad? to extend it ſelf to all, as well as to burn intenſively to any? And</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Doth not that that ſpeakes of God as ſo mercifull, illuſtrate alſo his juſtice the more brightly; when it ſhewes his wrath and vengeance to come upon men for abuſing love, undervaluing goodneſs, and for not accepting his grace? can any thing be thought more juſt then to puniſh him that tranſgreſſes a command of an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, in it ſelf not onely lawful, but alſo good and Fatherly? that not only by its ſoveraignty might exact, but alſo by its clemency and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs did deſerve obedience to its injunctions from all under it? ſuch as this doctrine declares Gods dealings with men by way of juſtice to be, not only in reſpect of <hi>Adam</hi> our firſt parent, and all in him, but alſo in reſpect of us in our particulars: and yet we aſcribe his Soveraignty to him in all things too; while we ſay all theſe his diſpenſations are not neceſſitated to him, but free and voluntary; ſo as that his giving Chriſt &amp; the ſtreams of goodneſs, that come to us through Chriſt, were all of his good will, not of our works; yea his extending theſe or thoſe means, longer or ſhorter time, with leſs or greater power, are all free diſpenſations according to his will; the Law he gives to men, and the rewards he propounds, all according to his own will, only we ſay he acts forth this his Soveraignty towards all in a moſt equal diſpenſation, in which he juſtifies himſelf to all that plead with him to be good and holy. And yet this doctrine leaves him at liberty too, to do to any one more or leſs, to make one more exemplary and ſingular in mercy, and another in ſeverity, as he pleaſes.</p>
            <p>But now the doctrine oppoſed by us, derogates from God in theſe things; for it ſpeakes of him in reſpect of moſt, as an <hi>Abaddon,</hi> not a Saviour, an <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; not a friend and lover of men, but a hater and deſtroyer of them; for what elſe I pray you ſpeakes that language that they preach as a truth concerning the greateſt part of men, that God hates them from eternity, and ſo in hatred made them, and neceſſitated their ſinning and periſhing? Is this to repreſent God lovely and gracious, or dreadful, and one that delights in mans miſery and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine? I know they ſay his love is but <hi>velle bonum creaturis,</hi> to will that that is good to creatures, and ſo that he may be ſaid to love them in that he gives them outward good things; in which I conceive they
<pb facs="tcp:117749:7"/>either give too ſcant a definition of his love, or call that good in it, that upon ſecond thoughts, if made their own portion, they would ſcarcely deem ſo. I conceive his love is rather to be thus defined, A <hi>velle bonum creaturis, quo iis benè eſſe poſſit:</hi> a willing good things to creatures for their good, for otherwiſe the willing of a good thing is not good, if it have in it a deſtructive intention, as for a man to will another a maſſy Wedge of Gold that he might caſt him into the Sea and drown him with it; and yet ſuch is their doctrine of Gods willing good things to moſt, for they make his firſt or eternal thoughts of them as to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be their miſery, and ſo all the bounty, patience, and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they have from him, to be to that end that they might by them ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at it, as ſome have ſaid; Gods dealings with ſome men are as if one ſhould hang a man in a Goldchain, or tie a wedg of Gold about his neck to ſink him. <hi>Quis talia fando temperet à lachrymis?</hi> Now while they thus deny the extent of his mercy and goodneſs, and give ſuch direful repreſentations of him, they alſo by conſequence obſcure his juſtice; for whereas his juſtice is illuſtrated by mercy, they that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure this muſt needs obſcure the other alſo. Juſtice is then ſeen in acts Retributive, when voluntary unneceſſitated tranſgreſſions are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely puniſhed, and by how much the more have been the advantages, incouragements, and liberty afforded for doing what is required, ſo much the cleerer is the equity of puniſhing the fault committed; How do they then cleer or magnifie Gods juſtice that make him to puniſh only neceſſitated wickedneſs? Yea that make the Decree of eternal vengeance upon ſuch and ſuch perſons to be in order of nature, Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daneous to any conſideration of ſin deſerving it? for theſe to be ſome of their conceptions and the ſum of their expreſſions too, they well know that are acquainted with any thing in this controverſie. Now I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to any rational underſtanding, whether of theſe two moſt declare and glorifie juſtice for a maſter to puniſh his ſervant for not doing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that he could not do, or doing what he could not but do, yea what he himſelf neceſſitates him to do? or for a maſter to puniſh his ſervant for that he gave him command and ability; yea alſo incouragement, and promiſed aſſiſtance for doing, and he voluntarily and ſlothfully neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected or refuſed to do it? Sure any man that hath his wits about him, will ſay this latter. But now againſt this particular I know what they object, and its Mr. <hi>Owens</hi> in his preface; <q>They ſay the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms of the world muſt not preſcribe to God, what way to glorifie himſelf in: its rather for us to aſcribe that glory to him that he
<pb facs="tcp:117749:8"/>makes his own, then deviſe ways for his glory by our inventions, and ſpeak lies in his behalf;</q> which things are in themſelves rightly ſpoken, onely they therein intimate that thoſe things which we have ſaid of God, are of our deviſing and aſcribing to him, which he neither aſcribes to himſelf nor owneth at our hands, to take off which we ſhall come to another particular, <hi>viz.</hi> That</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> The perſwaſion I have defended, is a truth of Gods own reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and not of our deviſing, but on the contrary, theirs a falſhood, not revealed by him, but deviſed by them; in which they as well give God the lye, as deny him to be love. What I here defend is grounded on the Scripture-expreſſions, in maintaining which I indeavor to keep cloſe to them, and ſubject reaſon to faith, theirs have no Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion to maintain it, but leans upon reaſon, exalting it ſelf againſt faith. They are the plain Scripture expreſſions, that God is love, hath loved the world, is good to all, the Saviour of all men, eſpecially of them that believe, that he delights in mercy, but delights not that the wicked ſhould die, but rather turn and live, that he is not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all come to Repentance; that his goodneſs, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance and long-ſuffering, is not to be deſpiſed, it leading to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, even ſuch, as not repenting, treaſure up wrath to themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the day of wrath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So alſo that Chriſt dyed for all and every one, that he gave himſelf a ranſome for all, and is the propitiation for the ſins of the whole world; if any hear him and believe not, he doth not judg him, becauſe he came not to judg the world, but to ſave the world. That thoſe whom he ſhall judg to death, he will ſo judge for their not believing in the light he gave them, for not hearing his voice, not receiving the truth, but impriſoning it in unrighteouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> theſe and many ſuch like are the revelations and expreſſions of the Holy Ghoſt in the Scriptures, upon which we ground our perſwaſion, deſiring ſimply to believe and hold them for true, yea though all things therein held forth, we knew not how by reaſon to comprehend, judging him true, and his word pure and perfect, but our reaſons and wiſdom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, and where it Judges it abſurd, to be folly, and bruitiſhneſs. We believe and receive alſo all thoſe places that they produce to us, as that he came to ſave his people, gave himſelf for his Church. Sheep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that the Saints and faithful were elected in Chriſt Jeſus before the foundation of the world; that God ſaid to <hi>Rebecca</hi> concerning <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> before they were born, or had done good or evil, that the elder of them (with his poſterity) ſhould ſerve the younger (with his) and
<pb facs="tcp:117749:8"/>that God ſaid by <hi>Malachy,</hi> that he loved the one and hated the other, and that God chuſes not either according to birth or works in us, which is the thing the Apoſtle brings it to prove, but that he hated either of them from Eternity, and before they had done either good or evil, or that he ſo hated the greater part of mankinde, that God loved only his elect and choſen, that he is only their Saviour; that Chriſt died only for them, and gave himſelf a ranſom only for his ſheep and Church, and did not die for the greateſt part of men, nor hath any fitneſs or ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency as a mediator for them to ſave them; that God did make the greateſt part of men with intention to deſtroy them, and never bare any good will to them, that they periſh for ever for the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> and that their condemnation is aggravated by their after ſins, for their neglecting that that was never for them, and for not repenting and believing on him, though there was neither object meet for them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on, nor any power vouchſafed to them from God, by which in attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God in the meanes propounded, they might have been brought to repent and believe, that all that Chriſt died for, ſhall be ſaved eternally, and none of them ſhall periſh; theſe and the like poſitions maintained by them, we finde no Scripture aſſerting, and ſo have no divine ground of believing: but to maintain them they rely on their reaſons, adding to, and detracting from the Scripture-expreſſions as they pleaſe, yea, plainly contradicting them, making particular affirmative propoſitions in Scripture equipollent to univerſal affirmatives, as, We, or the Church are ſanctified by his Death, <hi>ergo</hi> All that he died for: and particular Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatives, to be repugnant and contradictory to univerſal Affirmatives, as, He gave himſelf for us, <hi>ergo,</hi> Not for all; gave his life as a ſhepherd for his ſheep, <hi>ergo,</hi> he gave not himſelf a ranſome for all men: and many ſuch inept and unſcholarlike inferences their wiſdomes make to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and ſtrengthen their deviſed Aſſertions, drawing concluſions by them openly contradictory to the Scripture-expreſſions; as <hi>ergo</hi> He died not for all and every one: God would not that all men ſhould be ſaved, &amp;c. I would Maſter <hi>Owen,</hi> and the reſt of his minde, would be content that God ſhould be true, and reaſon be judged abſurd and vain where it oppoſes him; that he may have but that glory of his mercy, goodneſs, truth and Juſtice, that he in the Scriptures aſſerts to himſelf, we ſhould wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly hold us to that bargain with them. But alas how injurious they are to the truth of God too, and how unbelieving of, and contradictory to the Scriptures, thou mayſt ſee by this litle taſt here given, and more fully I hope by the treatiſe itſelf here preſented to thee as an anſwer to him; but
<pb facs="tcp:117749:9"/>yet I have not ſet before thee all the good and uſefulneſs of the truth here defended, nor all the evil of theirs oppoſed. For</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> This truth is profitable too for men, both in reſpect of themſelves and others, in both which regards too their counter-poſitions are injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: Firſt, In reſpect of mens ſelves to whom its propounded, &amp; who are to believe and receive it, its profitable for them to hear and receive it, becauſe it preſents to them an object for their faith, a motive to repent, believe, ſerve, and love God, and matter of comfort to them that lye in ſadneſs and diſtreſs, for want of ſeeing ground to hope in him; for this preſents God as loving and gracious to them; and what can be a greater motive to a man to liſten to God, then that his Doctrine comes in love and good will, and brings good to him? or what ſo powerful as love to break a man off from evils againſt him? a loving carriage in <hi>David</hi> toward <hi>Saul,</hi> melts him into tears, and brings him from ſeeking to harm him, to confeſs his evil and give good language to him; how much more ſhall the love of God preached to men, and believed by them, work upon them,
<note place="margin">

               </note> or elſe they ſhall be left the more excuſeleſs, and God ſhall be the more glorified in their deſtruction? It is not commands to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, but love and goodneſs in him that is offended, that indeed leads and brings in the heart to true repentance. So what will ſo effectually draw a ſoul to truſt in God, as when it hears and believes the goodneſs of God? Mansheart is ſo conſcious of its own evil, that neither commands or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes (eſpecially being ſo uncertain whether they appertain to us or no) will draw us in to betruſt our ſelves with God,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>1 John 4.19.</hi>
               </note> except we perceive ſome real Teſtimonies of his love firſt towards us. And what ſo ſtrong a cord to love and ſervice of him, as to ſee his love preventing us? Love ſeen and believed in him,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tit. 3.4, 5.</hi>
               </note> begets love and ſervice in us to him. We love him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he loved us firſt. Such our contrariety to God in our ſelves, and ſuch our apprehenſions of his contrariety to us, that till our hearts be purged from both by the demonſtrations of his love and goodneſs, we will not love and ſerve him, not ſerve him in love, without which our ſervice is not acceptable and delightful to him, ſo that from this love of God preached and believed, ſprings true obedience, and the hearty keeping of Gods Comandmments. Yea herein it is that men ſee their ſins moſt exactly odious, and are abaſed in the ſight of them. True, the Law ſaies what is good and evil, righteous and ſinful, but the Goſpel ſhews moſt lively the hainouſneſs of that ſin, while it preſents it not otherwiſe to be expiated then by the bloud of Gods own Son, and ſhews otherway no remiſſion, yea this love and goodneſs at once both humbles
<pb facs="tcp:117749:9"/>for ſin againſt God, and leads to hope in, and expect good from God; yea and while it ſpeaks not of an abſolute certainty of life and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for all, for whom Chriſt died, but theſe things to be certainly obtained in ſubmiſſion to him, believing on him, and yielding up to his Spirit, it leads the ſoul to ſerve the Lord with an holy fear, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in him with trembling, through which holy fear the heart is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from departing from him. So that this doctrine from the very word and Oracle of God, diſcovers to thee or any man (while yet not ſinning that great ſin to death) an object meet to look upon and admire, God meet to be turned to, ſought after, hoped in, and ſerved; yea, is a motive to, and a ground, foundation and ſpring of true comfort and godlineſs, of all which the contrary poſition deprives a man; No man by that beeing able as from the word of God to ſee good and right ground of loving, hoping in, and ſerving God, till he ſee that he do love, hope in, and ſerve him; there being nothing that bears witneſs of God to any particular ſoul (in their doctrine) that he loves and hath good will towards it, untill it ſee the diſcriminating, and diſtinguiſhing, electing love of God towards it, which is not to be ſeen by climbing up into heaven to ſearch into Gods ſecrets, but by finding in themſelves faith and ſanctification (they ſay) and thoſe too, ſuch as are ſo and ſo qualified, as may evidence them to be fruits of election, and ſo men muſt have the effects before and without their proper cauſe, which is love diſcovered to men. <hi>Tit. 3.4, 5, 6.</hi> they muſt have all theſe, Repentance, Faith, Love to God and men, Juſtification, Sanctification, yea and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps too eternal Glory before they ſhall ſee any ſolid ground or motive to repent, believe in him, ſerve and love him, or that Chriſt hath done any thing for them, by vertue of which he can juſtifie and ſanctifie them, and bring them to glory with him. And ſo they are not lead to deny ungodlineſs, and worldly luſts, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godlily, by Gods grace appearing in the Goſpel to them, but deny ungodlineſs, and live godlily (or rather pretend and ſeem to do ſo) that ſo grace might appear to them, and that they might ſee the goſpel declaration to belong to them. The Goſpel doctrine is to them but like the law, that is, a doctrine that conſiſts of duties commanded, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and threatnings annexed, without Goſpel motives of Gods love propounded; the viewing of which things the Spirit of Love breaths in, to lead, and to produce the things required; and ſo their endeavours after thoſe works and duties are looked upon as the fruits of grace and goodneſs, yea as the arguments of their Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:117749:10"/>paſt, and future happineſs, when they may be as far from both as the Phariſee that denied Gods free Grace to Publicans and ſinners, and yet judged himſelf a partaker of Gods Grace by his works of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, magnifying grace againſt free will, and thanking God as giving ſuch grace in thoſe things which were but the products of his will, neglecting and abiding ignorant of that grace in Chriſt, which would have truly corrected both his Judgment and will; ſuch the effect of this limiting, reſtraining doctrine as theirs alſo was. Men are led hereby to bottom the Goſpel it ſelf, with all arguments of love and goodneſs therein leading to faith and repentance, upon their faith and repentance, which they pretend they may have, before they know whether they have any ſolid ground for them or no, as if they could winde in themſelves into the perception of Gods love by their frames and endeavors, and not firſt be wrought up to them by the love and goodneſs of God perceived by them; and as if men ſhould look to themſelves and their endeavors, as the glaſs through which they ſhall ſee Gods love as for them; and not rather upon God and Chriſt as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the Goſpel to love them, as the glaſs in which they may ſee their obligation to God in Chriſt, and be moved to, and ſtrengthened in their ſeeking after him &amp; hoping in him. In that their way thou mayſt ſee that God commands thee to repent or change thy minde, to Judg him good and to love him, and that he threatens thee if thou doſt not, and promiſes great things to thee if thou doſt, but whether thou beeſt one of them that he intends any good in his promiſes to, or that art in a poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of attaining them, or only haſt them propounded to thy hearing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out good will towards thee (but that thou mighteſt thereby have the greater deſtruction) that by it thou knoweſt not; for it preſents no act of love from him that (according to it) thou canſt ſay reſpects thee, or takes thee in as the object of it; only do all thoſe things firſt, repent, believe, love, ſerve him, and then it ſhall be true for thee to believe that he hath good will to thee: a moſt prepoſterous way, that doth to men as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> takes away their ſtraw, and bids them get it themſelves, and yet exacts their number of brick; takes away that declaration of Gods love and good will to men that ſhould properly move them to repent, believe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſets men upon ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arguments and demonſtrations of theſe to themſelves, and yet not fail to perform thoſe duties required of them. A doctrine it is that preſents leſs love to this or that man, then the Law it ſelf did (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Apoſtle magnifies the true Goſpel as more excellent and more
<pb facs="tcp:117749:10"/>un vailed) for it ſet ſome certain demonſtrations of Gods goodneſs to the Iſraelites before them, as his bringing them out of Egypt, chuſing them in their Fathers to be a peculiar people to him, and many typical ſacrifices repreſenting Chriſts death for them, upon which they were commanded to love and ſerve him, but for ought this tells thee, thou wert hated by him from all eternity, yea this ſuggeſts to thee that all he doth to thee, may be but to bring thee to miſery. Nay I might ſafely ſay, Gods dealings with the Gentiles repreſented more goodneſs as to their particulars, without ſuggeſtions of eternal hatred of them, then this kind of Gospell-preaching aſcertains any one man of (as yet unregenerate) as truly goodneſs, and out of good will to him in particular. And O how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious is that doctrine to men that withholds the moſt abſolute &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect motive to their duties, and way to meet with conſolation. Whence it comes to paſs, that firſt many are led by it into preſumption, to lean upon themſelves, and their own works, as evidences of that diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love of God, that makes them ſure of ſalvation (as the Phariſee <hi>Luke. 18.9, 10.</hi>) and ſo of their being pure and righteous, when as yet they have never believed, and through faith received that love of God into their hearts thats preached in the Goſpel, to waſh and purify them, yea to bring them out of themſelves into Chriſt, that they might be reckoned after him, &amp; conformed to him, to ſalvation. Theſe are of thoſe that juſtifie themſelves, and labour to eſtabliſh a righteouſneſs of their own, and are ignorant of, and fight againſt the righteouſneſs of God; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing others, and hindring them of that Goſpel of grace that ſhould be opened to them; ſtumbling as much that the Death of Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be preached to all, to ungodly and ſinners not ſo qualified as they, as ever did the preſumptuous proud Phariſees, that Chriſt ſhould eat and drink with Publicans and ſinners, and that his Apoſtles ſhould preach the Gospel to the uncircumciſed Gentiles.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Others again are held in bondage all their dayes, and are ever ready to fall into deſperation, while not having the Love of God, and his goodneſs and grace propounded to them, as for them, that ſhould beget faith, hope, fruitfulneſs, &amp;c. or being hindered from believing it, as ſo propounded by occaſion of this limiting doctrine, and yet being preſſed on to believe, repent, be humble and broken, that ſo they may know that God hath good will to them, and hath given his Son for them, they labor and ſtrive, and finde nothing which they can attain to, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to demonſtrate their election, and ſo that there is any thing in Chriſts mediation for their wearied ſouls to reſt on; but on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb facs="tcp:117749:11"/>the more they look into themſelves, the worſe they finde themſelves, and the leſs ground to think God loves them, and ſo by conſequence, to hope in, believe on, love and ſerve him. The former throw by the corner ſtone, the ſure foundation, Gods good will in Chriſt held forth to them in the Goſpel, making that but a ſuperſtructure built upon their frames, endeavours and conceptions. The latter are Wholly without any founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but ſlote up and down without any ſetling: yea, and</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> Others go between both theſe, halting ſometimes the one way, and ſometimes the other: as they finde good frames (as they conceive) ſo they grow confident of their righteouſneſs, and like the Phariſee, dare go to God and thank him: and as they finde flaws again in their works and performances, ſo they ſink down again, and are ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that God never loved them, in the mean time how Hagariſh, ſelfiſh, phariſaicall, and ſlaviſh are all their ſervices to him! So that God is deprived of that ſervice and affection that he ſhould have from them, and themſelves of that good, incouragement, and comfort that they might have from him.</p>
            <p>And yet this is not all the evil that this doctrine doth to men, for it alſo in the very bowels of it holds forth an undenyable liberty to men, as yet unregenerate, to reaſon after this maner. Either they are ſuch as Chriſt died for, or not: if the firſt, then they are well enough, for all their ſins are ſatisfied for that they either have done or ſhall do, they may ſin freely, it cannot hurt them, for Chriſt hath drunk up every drop of wrath due to them, and ſhall not ſhed one drop of bloud more, or ſuffer any pain more then he hath for any thing they ſhall do againſt him; nor yet can God in Juſtice damn them, his Son having dyed for them; and therefore they will take no care, but follow their own wayes. If it be ſaid, ah but this will diſhonour God, and hurt others. What care unregenerate perſons for God or others, if they know not that God cares for them? its themſelves they moſt look at, and they can eaſily anſwer, his grace will be commended by forgiving them; and when they know he loves them, and gives them the grace, then they ſhall glorify him: And for others, if Chriſt died for them, it cannot hurt them, all is paid for that they ſhall commit, by occaſion of their walking, and they cannot miſs of eternal Salvation; otherwiſe, no matter what becomes of them, God cares not for them, and why ſhould they? If the latter (that Chriſt died not for them) then they cannot avoid ſuffering to the utmoſt what Gods hatred of them will lead him to inflict upon them: he hates them, and what cauſe have they then
<pb facs="tcp:117749:11"/>to love and ſerve Him? Why ſhould they deprive themſelves of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain preſent ſatisfactions to their mindes, to avoid what they no way can, or get that which no way is poſſible, or which they muſt have notwithſtanding if Chriſt hath died for them? So that be I one of theſe or thoſe (may ſuch a one ſay) its beſt for me to take my pleaſure here, at leaſt till God make me do otherwiſe, for if Chriſt died for me, I ſhall have the pleaſure of ſuch ſins here, and happineſs hereafter too; if not, then I had better have my pleaſure here, then not at all. This kinde of reaſoning, I ſay, that directly tends to looſeneſs and neglect of the means of Salvation, ſprings from the bowels of this Doctrine; whereas from the truth that I have endeavoured to defend, no ſuch bad conſequence follows, but it ſets before men ſure ground of hoping in, and loving God, and yet cauſe of watchfulneſs and diligence to ſeek him, leaſt by neglecting him they deprive their Souls of that good he ſet before them. Its true, many in that way perhaps may not yeild up to ſuch reaſoning as I have ſaid, but yet the Doctrine gives them ground for it, nor can the defenders of it be able to diſprove it. Its true again, ſome that believe the truth may abuſe it, but it gives no fair ground for it, as may eaſily be ſeen: we are not to judge of doctrines by mens practices that hold them, becauſe their conſciences and practick principles may contradict their erronious ſpeculations; or their wills and affections cauſe them to warp from their true principles of judgment. A Phariſaical <hi>Saul</hi> may walk more ſtrictly then a Chriſtian <hi>Corinth,</hi> but by their natural undeniable influences into mens practices we may judg that to be erronious, that leaves men to, and upholds them in a looſe practiſe, not that that is turned from, into a looſe practice, which it doth diſcountenance.</p>
            <p>I know it is ſometime objected againſt what I plead for, that by it a man may be led to take liberty to ſin, and do what he pleaſes, for he may repent when he pleaſes, its in his own power. But to that I ſay, its a ſlander caſt falſly upon our doctrine. For we deny that its in a mans power to repent and believe, as, and when he will, but only as, and when God gives it him, when God works upon him, and affords ability to him, and that he gives alſo in ſuch means as he hath pitcht on, and when he pleaſes: ſo that its needful that men neglect no opportunities that he preſents to them, nor preſume upon their power or Gods patience; for though we affirm that God gives them his help in his ſeaſons, and ſuccors them in the day of ſalvation, yet if that be neglected or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in vain, God may juſtly cut it ſhort with them, and therefore
<pb facs="tcp:117749:12"/>it ſtands men in hand to take his times and ſeaſons, and lay hold on his ſtrength when he reaches it forth to them, for (as one ſayes well) <hi>qui promiſit poenitenti veniam, non promiſit procraſtinanti poenitenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am.</hi> But to paſs from this particular. Of their doctrine its further obſervable, That</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> Its injurious alſo in reſpect of mens doing good to others, while it takes away thoſe motives of doing good, that the truth propounds unto them; For firſt as it obſcures the apprehenſions of Gods goodneſs in mens ſelves, which are moſt effectual motives to do good to others. If he ſo loved us, we ought alſo to love one another. So alſo, Secondly, It takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Gods example of being good to all, and rather preſents him as an example of pretending one thing, and intending another, as if we might hate, and ſeek to harm ſome men in our hearts, ſo we do but ſpeak them kindely, and thats to love and be merciful as God is. Yea, and it puts us upon a ſtraight, whom really to love and pitty, becauſe we cannot be certain whom God loves and pitties, and ſo that we do not love whom God hateth. And thirdly, It takes away that doctrine that we ſhould hold forth, that word of life by which we ſhould win men, for it makes it uncertain to them that undertake to preach, whom they ſhould hold forth Goſpel motives of Repentance and Faith to, I mean, any good will in God toward them to be teſtified to them, to draw them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and believe in him; whence many Miniſters are put to it about Gospel preaching, yea in ſtead thereof become teachers of the Law, and jumble Law and Gospel together, ſo that they confound them, that they neither preach Law or Gospel, but a mingle mangle of both, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what they ſay, nor whereof they affirm; talking of duties to them that want principles to perform them rightly, and not declaring to them that doctrine of Gods goodneſs that ſhould, by declaring his love to them rightly principle them: telling men of believing, and of the fruits and priviledges of faith, but not holding forth Chriſt to men as one that dyed for them, and ſo is become a ſure foundation for their faith: Yea, telling men that are yet in unregeneracy, of election and reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though none can underſtand them aright, or make uſe of them profitably, till brought into Chriſt, in whom Election is, and for reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whom God rejecteth and reprobateth: an unprofitable doctrine to them, and good for little, as many teach it to ſuch, but either to lead men to a careleſs preſumption or drive them into desperation. Nay, in ſtead of preaching Gospel to every creature, they cannot preach Gospel in a certain ſound (ſo as they or the hearer may ſay its Gospel to him) to
<pb facs="tcp:117749:12"/>any creature, except they preſume they firſt ſee in him ſome fruits of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection. And ſo I conceive its a doctrine very ſerviceable to Satans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of hindering men from ſeeing that glorious grace of God in Chriſt, in and by which they ſhould be turned into him, the contrary to all which is evidently affirmable of the Doctrine there pleaded for.</p>

I know its ever an enemy to the truth of God, and to its own good, through the ſubtile working of Satan, with the craftineſs of the ſeeming prudent men, high in eſteem with it. I know (for I ſometimes hear) how ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porbous, ſupercilious men deride the ſimplicity of the words and Goſpel of Chriſt, how generally they fling againſt it, and caſt dirt upon it; ſo that we may truly ſay, the viſage and form of Chriſt is marred more then any form, and the truth of God in this matter rendred more contemptible then any doctrine; they that will not abide an argument or two to their faces, yet if they get into a Pulpit where none may inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt them, or elſewhere, where there are none to anſwer them (like the hypocritical mockers at feaſts ſpoken of <hi>Pſal. 35.16.</hi>) then they will gird and argue ſtrenuouſly againſt it, or deride and vilifie thoſe that preach it, and more ingenuous men, and confident of their cauſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in print againſt it. I know the moſt odious names of Pelagianiſm, Semipelagianiſm, and Arminianiſm are caſt upon it, as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maratiniſm, and Sathaniſm too were often caſt on Chriſt to make him odious and fear people from him: on the other ſide, their device is clothed with the names of ſound and Orthodox doctrine, and ſhews its pedegree as high as <hi>Proſper,</hi> and Saint <hi>Auſtin.</hi> The world deals with theſe two doctrines, as ſome would have the Kingdom deal with Presbyterie, and Independency (as they call them) as <hi>Tamars</hi> Midwiſe dealt with her two children. It ſays concerning their doctrine as ſhe of <hi>Zarah,</hi> this came out firſt, it is the eldeſt brother, and they would have a Scarlet thred upon it, eſtabliſh it by a civil bloody Sanction, and ſo authorize it to ſuppreſs the truth that is oppoſed by them; of which they ſay, as ſhe of the ſuppoſed yonger, but indeed the Elder (for Chriſt was in his bowels and he came out firſt) its

I know the truth of the old adage, <hi>Obſequium amicos, veritas odium parit,</hi> flattery is befriend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and conformity to mens determinations is eſteemed, but the truth is hated. I look for my cleaving in this to the word of God, to be ranked with the worſt of Hereticks, and to meet with no better name with this generation then Chriſt and his former ſervants have met with in theirs. I look to have my name caſt out as odious, and made to ſtink in the noſtrils of men (or elſe Satan and his inſtruments will want of their will) while they that oppoſe the truth of God grow fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous: but I much matter not, its but the reward with men that Chriſt hath appointed for his followers: Its his ſaying to his ſervants, <hi>ye ſhall be hated of all men for my names ſake;</hi> and its properly the name of Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> That he is <gap reason="foreign">

As he is in the humane nature, choſen to be the holy one of Iſrael (as united to the Divine) ſo we are choſen in him to be holy, a dedicate people, and ſelect portion for his inhabitation (as the Temple in that ſenſe with the Land and People of Iſrael were called holy) and to be blameleſs before him in love, that is, as preſented without blame and reproof in Chriſt, and to be made blameleſs by Chriſt, and ſo thoſe that are believers in Chriſt,
<pb facs="tcp:117749:14"/>are bleſſed, and were ſo choſen to bleſſing, holineſs and blameleſneſs in him from eternity; (as the preſent Freemen of <hi>Lynn</hi> might be ſaid to have been by foregoing Kings, choſen to ſuch priviledges as they have now, in the firſt chuſing it to be a Corporation, and in thoſe that were then made members of it, though many of theſe preſent members (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps all of them) were then in their progenitors other Country-men) ſo I ſay thoſe that are now belivers, were in Chriſt before the Worlds foundation, choſen to the priviledges they have in and by him, being alſo foreknown of God, both that they ſhould be in Chriſt, and as owned in Chriſt, and predeſtinuted in that his foreknowledge and own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be made like his Son, whom in order of nature he had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained as their pattern to dye, riſe, and be glorified, in all which he ordained his foreknown ones, even them that believe in him ſhould be conformed to him, and unto which he called them, and in that confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in ſufferings, juſtifies and maintains them, and (as he hath done, ſo yet) he doth bring them to glory with him. Yea in his calling men, we deny not his liberty of pulling in more powerfully, preſerving from general Apoſtacies, actuall chuſing and ordaining in his Son glorified to their hearts, whom he pleaſes, and as he pleaſes: but that either any company of men, as in themſelves, &amp; as of the world, uncal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are ever called (or ſignified by the word) Elect; much leſe that any were choſen to be the object of Chriſts death, and the others left out (Election being ever coupled with (or reſpecting) mens calling to Chriſt, and right to his priviledges, not Chriſts dying) I can no where finde in Scripture. Beſides that which is more ſecret and myſterious in his decree or dealings, we neither confound with what he hath done in the death of Chriſt for us and declares in the Goſpel to us as the object of our faith, or motive to believe, and that in which he ſo calls, puls in, and ſaveth according to his good pleaſure. Nor dare we make them to run croſs to the Scriptures, that more plainly declare his good will and love to men, acknowledging rather our want of capacity to comprehend thoſe more abſtruſe things, then daring to call in queſtion the extent of the truth of his other expreſſions that are more fitted to our underſtanding, and ſpeak to the more intelligible principles of Chriſtian Religion. Nor finde we warrant for making our narrow conceptions of thoſe more abſtruſe things of God (which are ever deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in Scripture without any oppoſition to, or limitation of the things we treat of) to be the meaſure of, and to give limits to them: they that ſo do, both contradicting the Scripture expreſſions in the things we

And to make exceptions without warrant in the word of God about the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Goſpels doctrine, I judg very dangerous.

<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10.4.</note> How can this thing be? they are but high imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and thoughts, exalting themſelves againſt obedience to the faith of Jeſus,

Reaſon being a part of that ſelf of ours, which he that will be Chriſts Diſciple muſt deny, in what it would ſtop us from receiving the doctrines he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds to us. So that this is but a trick of Satan, to ſtir up men to caſt ſuch ſtumbling conſiderations in their own and others way, that they might not believe and have the benefit of the truth declared to them: to whom its beſt to ſay, Get thee behinde me Satan, to leave diſputing and inquiring into things more ſecret, and ſay either produce me ſome Scripture that ſaith, he dyed not for them, or elſe be ſilent. Its good in ſuch caſes to take what Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Peter,</hi> curiouſly inquiſitive after <hi>John,</hi> for a ſatisfactory anſwer. How God deals with them (further then the Scripture ſays) what is that to thee? they ſhall be found ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeleſs when Chriſt ſhall Judg them, and therefore follow thou Chriſt in the receit of his word and let not any ſeeming abſurdities, to thy rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, prevaile to impede thee.

Such a queſtion might have been as well made by many <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the wilderneſs: might not reaſon thus have led them to argue, either God abſolutely willed to poſſeſs us all of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi>

Nay if our corrupt and blinde reaſon ſhall be umpire, then what Satan and unbelief ſuggeſts, is righter then what God himſelf ſaith, for did not the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> periſh in the Wilderneſs many of them (as their reaſon and unbelief ſuggeſted) and did they attain to <hi>Canaan,</hi> though that was the promiſe ſet before them? but as we ſaid before, Let God be true, and every man in his beſt wiſdom but a blinde fool and liar. We durſt not believe our carnal reaſonings against Gods word, nor exclude, inlarge, or limit his word by our own hearts dictates, but as we ſee God in other places inſtruct us to it. Not but that we can give reaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable anſwers to their reaſons againſt Chriſts dying for the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then; they being all faln in <hi>Adam,</hi> and the ſentence being executable upon them, and all men in him in the day that he ſinned, ſo that what life and mercies of life, with goodneſs leading to ſeek after God, and to repent, they do injoy, may well and neceſſarily be conceived to ſpring from Chriſts interpoſing himſelf as mediator and ranſome; But yet if any can ſhew that Chriſt died but for all in theſe latter times, or that the Goſpel is preached to, and ſhew it by Scripture proofs, we will be willing ſo to interpret thoſe general expreſſions, till when we cannot admit of that interpretation.</p>

Now if this objection ſuit not to the Scriptures in general, but only to ſome places, then who ſhall tell us what they are in which it ſuits not?

Now this point we ſpeak of, namely the death of Chriſt, and for whom it is, is fundamental, and the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that the Apoſtle, the Teacher of the Gentiles lays down as the Teſtimony he Preached in the other parts of them, are very plain and perſpicuous; And that this only, that he gave himſelf a ranſom for all, ſhould be obſcure, is a groundleſs evaſion of them that do not believe the truth; ſeeing in their preachings of the Goſpel he himſelf tels us they put no vaile over their faces in their miniſtration, but manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the truth to every ones conſcience, which ſure they did not, if they ſpake ſo figuratively, that many might miſtake, and few could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their meaning, as is pretended.

As for that inference of tranſubſtantiation, we deny it (or the reſt) proveable upon that ſuppoſal; No one Scripture ſaying, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt called the bread his body, or the cup he took in his hand his blood, more then that he ſaid to the Jews, deſtroy the Temple that he was walking in, <hi>John 2.</hi> but by this he might mean and indeed point to his preſent body, and by this Cup his preſent inſtant ſufferings that he was about to undergo, which the Scripture and himſelf alſo cals a Cup, and the Cup that his Father gave him, much leſs ſay they that the one or other was turned into his natural body or blood, nor is the parallel fair between the doctrines of the Goſpel preached, as the firſt principles of faith, and theſe Sacramental and more myſterious ſpeeches.

Yea further, I underſtand and believe, that God by his goodneſs, and with and in thoſe means prevents men, and wroks in them, manifeſting his truth in them, and giving them a diſcerning apprehenſion of it, with convincing or drawing power; and that he then gives them ability to do what they could not before, as to acknowledg the folly he ſhews them, confeſs the truth and goodneſs he makes evident to them, ſtrive againſt the ways they ſee harm them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though yet theſe are not ſpiritual acts of divine and Chriſt like life, they ſpringing from ſelf-love, and deſire of their own proper good, not out of love to God. But they, that when they are ſo prevented, and in
<pb facs="tcp:117749:17"/>ſuch preventions reproved, called, allured to liſten further to God in the means afforded, do ſtop their ears, cloſe their eyes, harden their hearts, impriſon the truth they ſee, and neglect to uſe the power given them in theſe ſtrivings of Gods truth with them, are juſtly guilty of their own deſtruction, ſhould God there leave them, and ſtrive no longer with them: and they that turn at ſuch reproofs, and liſten yet to the truth, that ſpeaks to them, and do not ſlothfully neglect the power and liberty therein given them, may meet (yea are in the way to meet) with further operations of the truth to convert and heal them, to give life, yea di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine principles of life, hope in God, and faith in God to them; he having ſaid, that ſuch as turn at his reproofs ſhall have the Spirit poured upon them, and his words made known to them, and they that liſten to him (though dead) ſhall live, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that meerly out of his grace and good will toward them, not out of either merits of Congruity or Condignity found in them. Though that God paſſes by many rebellions in ſuch caſes, and out of more abundant love, where he pleaſes, draws more prevailingly even thoſe that have more rebelled, &amp; many times paſſes by thoſe that have leſs, may be eaſily proved And wherein this, or any thing in this, either contradicteth or jarreth with the Scriptures, I as yet ſee not. That men may exerciſe or uſe their inatural faculties in the things in which God uſeth to ſhine in light to men as well as in others, as to hear the word, as well as to hear other diſcourſes, I ſee no ground of denying, though they cannot hear with ſuch pleaſure and delight as they do other things, till ſomething there heard doth take them, yet hear they may; and mens negligence in ſuch things is called ſlothfulneſs (which ſtands not in a mans not doing what he cannot, but in not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying to do according to liberty and might) and rebellion, when joyned with wilfulneſs. Now whereas its ſaid, that ſhould men do to the utmoſt what they can, by that light and power given, yet that their doing would not ſave them. To that I anſwer, that its not material, for firſt, as to the buſineſs in hand, its enough that they have power and liberty from God to do more then they do. <hi>2.</hi> Its granted, that no act that God gives any man power to do, can ſave him by its ſelf. Its not of him that willeth, or of him that runneth,
<note place="margin">Rom. 9.6.</note> but of God that ſheweth mercy: but is not he that bids them liſten to him, and gives them light to ſee and diſcern ſuch truths, and motion to own and follow them, able to ſave them? or doth he any where give any intimation, that upon their acting forth in theſe his workings
<pb facs="tcp:117749:17"/>in and with them, according to the power and liberty he gives, he will refuſe to do any thing more for them, by which they ſhould be brought nearer to him, ſo as they might be ſaved? If they have, then indeed they may well be ſlothful, and ſay, I had as good ſtay where I am, and ſtifle what I ſee, for yeelding up to it will not ſave me, nor will God do any thing to that purpoſe further for me, and ſo their ſlothfulneſs and rebellion may finde ſome excuſe; If not, then it appertaines to them to hear his voice, and (as <hi>Caleb ſaid</hi> in another caſe) only not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, nor be ſlothful, and let God alone with what pertains further to their eternal welfare; which if they refuſe to do, they have no excuſe, in as much as for ought they know, and that God hath ſaid to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary (nay rather by what he ſays he would have done for others, had they harkened to his voice, they might hopefully conceive that) he would have revealed greater things to them,
<note place="margin">Pſal. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

So that they cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe themſelves with pleading, as the evil ſlothful ſervant (and as many teach men to plead) that God is a hard Maſter, gathering where he ſtrawed not, and reaping where he ſowed not, they cannot ſay he refuſed to give them faith, and further grace or knowledg of himſelf, requiſite to ſave them; ſeeing they were unfaithful in that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent he gave them, which had they improved as he willed and inabled them, they might have had more for ought they or any know, given them. That ſuch are Gods dealings with men, as are above declared, many Scriptures intimate, as that he manifeſts his truth in them, and they ſay to him, Depart from us, &amp;c. His goodneſs leads men to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, they ſhut their eyes, and cloſe their ears, leaſt they ſhould ſee, hear, underſtand, and be converted, and ſo God ſhould heal them, for which things God alſo many times in juſt judgment blindes, deafs and hardens them too, and ſeals them up to their deſtruction, but he firſt ſtrives with men, and reproves them, bids them turn at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs, and he will pour out his ſpirit upon them, and tells them when he gives them up, it was becauſe they would none of him, would not hear him, would not chuſe his fear, liked not to have the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of him, and ſayes, had they hearkened to him, their peace had been as the Rivers, and their righteouſneſs as the waves of the ſea, and he would have done thus and thus for them with many ſuch like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions: but that any Scripture ſays, that as men are naturally dead in ſins and trespaſſes, ſo he manifeſts no truth to them, or gives no power with that truth manifeſted by which they might grope after him,
<pb facs="tcp:117749:18"/>would not, did they walk out in what he gives them, give any more knowledg of Himſelf or Son unto them, and would not bring them to believe, &amp;c. We are yet to learn: or that ever any did ſo, and were there left by him notwithſtanding, and were condemned by him. Theſe things I ſay we neither finde plainly expreſſed in Scripture, nor dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier intimated.</p>
            <p>And that this derogates at all from Gods glory, or liberty to ſhew more mercy, as, and where he pleaſes, I would fain have any man to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate to me. Yea, I appeale to any equal Judg, whether this clears not the equity of Gods way far more, and ſuits not better with the Scripture expreſſions, then to ſay, he gives them no ſuch power or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and yet condemns them for not doing what they no waies might have done, and doing what was no waies to be avoided by them, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of men to act out all that ſtrength that in <hi>Adam</hi> was given, and puniſhing them as they fail in that. Surely by the rule Jew and Gentile ſhould both alike be puniſhed (they both equally by nature being deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of that righteouſnes and ſtrength) and not one more then another, according to more or leſs now vouchſafed to them. So that this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection about free will is a meer rub caſt in thy way too; no ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion being provable by Scripture, as that God gives to many men no power or liberty to do any thing that he requiers of them, or that did they conſtantly act forth according to what he gives them, yet he would do nothing more to them, that would lead them to ſalvation; or that Chriſt dyed only for ſuch as he gives liberty to, ſo as to bring them in actually and effectually to believe on him, and be ſaved by him, as ſhall be ſeen in the enſuing Anſwers to Maſter <hi>Owen.</hi> As for other queſtions [as whether any be brought to ſalvation by God, that improve that liberty he gives them? or any that are not more extraordinarily over-powred by him?] as they are matters of curioſity, by which many men detain themſelves from doing that that God ſets before them, and from ſtriving to enter the ſtrait gate for their particulars, ſo I ſhall wave them, and draw to a concluſion.</p>
            <p>Only whereas by mentioning the ſtrait gate, I am minded of another ſtumble that ſome hit on, <hi>viz.</hi> That this doctrine makes the way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven broader then God hath made it, and the gate wider, and tends to daube up men with untempered morter, and to heal their hurts ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; <hi>Objections</hi> that I hear ſometimes urged with that pretence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of ſtrength in them, that a man would judg them to have ſome
<pb facs="tcp:117749:18"/>weight indeed, though I rather pity, and could lament their miſtakes, then admire their acuteneſs in ſuch charges: I ſhall briefly ſay a word or two thereto. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand therefore I pray thee, that the ſtraitneſs of a gate ſtands not in this, that its opened but for a few, nor the wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it, in that its opened for many; a narrow gate or paſſage may be expoſed to, and open for all, or for any that will go through it, and a wider paſſage may ſtand open but for few: beſides its not here as in other doors or gates, that the throng of paſſengers preſſes men, and makes them finde hard entrance: No, in this ſpiritual gate the more enterers the eaſier, the number of believers rather facilitates the paſſage, then makes it difficult; but the narrowneſs of the gate ſtands in this, that this grace expoſed to all, hath ſuch operations upon them that enter it, to empty and abaſe them in themſelves, and for denying their wiſdom, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, reaſon, confidence in works; and the enterers of it meet with ſuch calumnies, reproaches, ſufferings, &amp;c. that its difficult to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, few can finde in their hearts to ſtoop to ſuch abaſement and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings as it leads to; Chriſt is a ſtrait gate, as rubbing ſo much of man off in their liſtening to him and walking after him, not in his being given for but a few of men, for if that was the ſtraitneſs of it, he might be wide enough for them that he died for, and they might finde no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in entring into God by him. As for daubing up ſouls with untem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered morter, and healing their hurts ſlightly, there might indeed be ſome colour of charging us with it, if we taught men as they do, That all that Chriſt died for, ſhall certainly be ſaved, and no ſin imputed to them, or if we only told men that Chriſt died for them all; but we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver no ſuch doctrine as the firſt, nor finde juſt ground for it by any Scripture-expreſſion, and beſides the latter, we in preaching the Goſpel endeavour to bring men to ſee their need of having Chriſt, in that they cannot have life but in having him, and in being emptied of themſelves, and found in him, and ſo we endeavour to bring men to that ſelf-emptineſs of wiſdom, ſtrength and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their own, which they who thus object are many of them afraid to be brought to, which is the wounding work of the Goſpel, which when they are brought to, we apply no other plaiſter to them, then Chriſts ſufferings,
<note place="margin">Zech. 13.10. Gal. 2.20, 21. Rom. 3.3.</note> by thoſe we endeavour both to wound men in diſcovering the hainouſneſs of their ſins thereby, and their emptineſs of true righteouſneſs and wiſdom, which things are beſt to be ſeen in his croſs; and again, to heale
<pb facs="tcp:117749:19"/>them, in ſetting before them the greatneſs of Gods love therein toward them, and the incouragement it affordeth to wait on him for giving forth his Spirit to them, to unite them to his Son, and ſo to impart his Sons priviledges to them, which when they are brought to, their ſores are truly healed; for if this be to heal them ſlightly, and the blood and grace of Chriſt be but untempered morter, then I know not wherewith truly to heal them; for my part, I deſire healing to my ſoul by no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Medicine: Their daubings that tell ſouls they may know that Chriſt loves them by their good deſires and indeavours, ſtrifts and labours, from hope in, and by which, ſouls ſhould rather be taken, my ſoul abhorreth; they being indeed but untempered morter that God appointed not for mens reſt and healing. They are thoſe dawbings that make many believe that they are in Chriſt already, who have no more then what the Phariſee <hi>(Luke 18.11.)</hi> and the falſe Apoſtles <hi>(2 Cor. 10.7.)</hi> boaſted of, who truſted in themſelves, that they were Chriſts, The direct way which) by nurſing up ſouls in ſelf confidence that they are in Chriſt) keeps many a ſoul from coming unto Chriſt, and ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing throughly after Chriſt, for which ſuch daubers ſhall one day anſwer.</p>
            <p>But I have exceeded the bounds of an Epiſtle. I ſhall ſay no more as to the doctrine, only why I rather anſwered to Maſter <hi>Owen,</hi> then any other, I give thee theſe reaſons. The good report I heard of him for ingenuity and learning, and the high eſteemes this his book had with many, the freeneſs of it from ingaging any one particular, more then ſome others lightly publiſht, and the deſire of a worſhipful, and loving friend or two, that I would peruſe it, made me rather give it theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Anſwers; the ſubſtance of others being alſo in it, ſo that in Anſwering him, little of them can be ſaid to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwered. I confeſs, at firſt I thought only to overthrow his main pillars upon which his diſcourſe leaneth, and leave his Arguments to fall with them; but finding it his deſire, that the anſwer would not only <hi>vellicare,</hi> ſpeak but to here and there a paſſage; to avoid that imputation, I armed my ſelf with a little more patience, and went through with it Chapter by Chapter, as thou ſeeſt, only omitting that occaſional diſcourſe againſt ſome
<pb facs="tcp:117749:19"/>Socinians that in his third book he inſerteth, it having nothing in it againſt me, but rather on my ſide.</p>
            <p>I know that I am no whit worthy to be compared with him in learning, ſo called, in which both time, opportunities, and his own diligence have given him much ſuperiority and advantage over me. But I hope I am not behinde hand with him in fair dealing with, and pertinent ſpeaking to an argument. What I have done in this Anſwer, and whether I have refelled his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments or not, I muſt leave to thy judgment.</p>
            <p>If thou findeſt it unſatisfactory (as I hope to intelligent and impartiall men it will not be) judge it rather my weakneſs in handling the matter, then the cauſes wrongneſs; accept my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, and paſs by my infirmities. In fairneſs of language I conceive I am not ſhort of him, though I may be in elegancy of expreſſion. If upon reading this Treatiſe, thou beeſt perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the truth of what it defendeth, reſt not in the bare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of it, as if that was enough for thee, but follow on to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and ſeek after God, that hath ſuch good will toward thee; and walk out in what he diſcovers of himſelf to thee, that ſo he may be pleaſed to diſcover himſelf more to thee, and draw thee by his Spirit into union with, and conformity to his Son, that thou mayeſt have the utmoſt healing that the death of Chriſt brings to the believer, even ſalvation, with eternal glory. The right uſe of truth is in being lead from the world and thy own ſelf to God by it, and ſo attaining the end propounded to thee in it.</p>
            <p>If thou, not liking what is writ wilt, reply upon me, I deſire thee to do it ſoberly, and as a ſeeker of truth rather then of victory, bate pride and paſſion, which will but darken thine underſtanding, and nothing advantage thee in thy anſwering; and take heed leſt for fear of loſing thine honour, or for deſire to get any, thou robbeſt God of the honour of his truth, and ſhutteſt thine eyes againſt thoſe flaſhes of his light that he darts into thee. Better loſe thine honour, then ingage againſt Gods truth for it.</p>
            <p>If thou likeſt the truth pleaded for, but findeſt defect or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in any of my expreſſions in aſſerting it, I ſhall be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be helpt to ſee better by thy ſpectacles, if thou pleaſeſt to lend them me.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas God (who is love it ſelf) beholding mankinde faln, and through the ſubtlety of the Serpent plunged into death and miſery, was pleaſed out of pitty towards him, to finde out a way for his recovery, even to ſend forth his own proper Son, his Word and Wiſdom, to take upon him the nature of man ſo faln, with the infirmities, weakneſſes, death and miſery attending it (yea the whole puniſhment that the ſin of man had in that fall contracted to it) that ſo he dying for man, man might be delivered out of that death; and life and immortality might be again brought to light; yea, whereas the Son of God
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:117749:21"/>having accordingly given himſelf a ranſom for all, it hath pleaſed the Father (out of the ſame love he bare to man in ſending him) further to provide for his good, in exalting this his Son that ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and making him Lord and Chriſt, a Prince and Saviour, one that ſhould have (and anſwerably hath) power and authority over all things, and Salvation in him; authority and fitneſs to ſave and deliver out of evil, and to bring to life and glory, whoever of the perſons of men liſten and look to him for Salvation; whoever obey his Word, ſubmit to his Spirit, and give up themſelves to be ordered by him; and to that end hath in theſe laſt dayes given forth a commiſſion, to certain Elected and choſen perſons, appointed for that purpoſe by him, to be his Witneſſes and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors to the whole world in general, to proclaim, publiſh, and declare this that God hath done, in, and by Chriſt Jeſus for them, and to let them know his good will toward them, that he would not that any of them ſhould periſh, but all come to Repentance, and to the knowledg, or acknowledgment of his truth, that they might be ſaved (to which end he hath alſo given and conſtituted his Son to be a witneſs, and a Leader to conduct them to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) and upon theſe grounds hath willed them to exhort, command, intreat, and urge all and every man (as they have opportunity to it) to accept this grace, believe the Goſpel, repent and turn to God from their dead works, and from their follies, and to Jeſus as the only one conſtituted by him to be his Salvation, even to the ends of the earth. So it is, that ſince theſe holy men of God, to whom the tenor of the Goſpel and doctrine of truth was firſt committed, have faln aſleep, the vigilant and wicked enemy of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde hath not only through his ſubtlety prevailed with multitudes of thoſe men to whom this proclamation hath been made, to reject, perſecute, and put away this Embaſſage, both from themſelves and peoples under them, and poſterities ſucceeding them, and with many others to be ſlothful, and not to take care to propagate this Doctrine of their Lord and Maſter, but alſo by occaſion of this wickedneſs, and ſlothfulneſs of men, many that pretend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be underſtanding men, and ſervants of God unto their brethren, have come with a counter-doctrine pretending to have better inſight into the minde of God, then the letter of the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical preaching doth hold forth (even as at firſt Satan pretended to the woman to have a more ſublime knowledg of the minde of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117749:21"/>God and to teach her better underſtanding of it then in the ſimple belief of Gods words to them, they had attained) telling men that God ſent not his Son for all of them, but only for here and there one, they nor any man elſe not knowing who they be, and that Chriſt gave himſelf only for them, and for no others: and this they pretend to have from a more Seraphical underſtanding of a more ſecret will of God, by which means they both contradict the tenor of the holy Commiſſion delivered out to his Saints, and left by them upon record for us, by the inſtinct of his ſpirit; and take away thoſe certain and more excellent grounds, motives, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements to believe, repent, ſeek after, and love God, which that Commiſſion affordeth, making the Goſpel to give ſuch an uncertain ſound, that none can by it be induced to prepare himſelf to battel, as is more largely ſhewed in the Epiſtle to the Reader. In which doing they greatly deny, at leaſt diſſerve the Lord that bought them, in that in ſtead of making him lovely to all, and an object meet for all to commit themſelves to, and forſake all for the worſhipping and confeſſing of, they render it doubtful what one hath cauſe ſo to do, and not rather to hate him as a fore (yea eternal) hater of them, that had ſuch deſire to their miſery, as therefore to create them, yea therefore to do all that he doth about them, that they might at laſt for ever be more heavily tormented by him. So that they do herein as a company of ſlaves or perſidious Traitors ſhould do to a King, who having made open proclamation of ſatisfaction received by the hand of ſome Prince, for the miſchief done him by a company of rebells, and of his good will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them all, that he would have them to lay down their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, upon which they ſhould be received into his favour; and that for aſſurance thereof and incouragement to the ſubmiſſion required, he grants them pardon and an act of oblivion for all paſt; they ſhould come with an after-pretended proclamation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration; pretending that they are of the Kings privy Councel, and know his minde, better then in that proclamation, to which he had ſet his hand and ſeal, was declared, and telling thoſe Rebels that they know his meaning in thoſe general expreſſions to be, that only here and there a man of them are included in the Princes ſatisfaction, and toward them only the King bears good will, the greateſt part of them he ſo hates, that he excluded them the ſatisfaction and act of oblivion for that thats paſt, by which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117749:22"/>meanes they ſhould ſtrengthen them in their rebellion, it being evident to none of them, who are of the one or of the other, and ſo who hath cauſe to rely upon the ſatisfaction given, and act of oblivion granted. Now for the honour of God and of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, I here defend the Apoſtical againſt their counter Commiſſion, accuſing their innovation of it as falſe and fained, and of evil conſequence, and all the pretenders in it to be therein guilty of high Treaſon againſt the Crown, Royalty, love, goodneſs and ſoveraignty of the Son of God; in altering, changing and contradicting his proclamation, putting in another in ſtead thereof, of their own deviſing, to the great obſcuring and diſhon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouring of his name, and prejudice to the ſons of men, as is before hinted. And whereas one Maſter <hi>Owen</hi> amongſt the reſt hath late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put out a Treatiſe impleading the true Commiſſion and procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Goſpel, and pleading for this other of mans deviſing; my intention is here in this inſuing Treatiſe, to defend and bear witneſs to the old Apoſtolical Goſpel againſt him, and to that end to examine and bring to Tryall all his arguments that he pretends againſt it, and for his opinion, according to the good hand of God with me, refelling and laying open the vanity and falſhood of them, and their ground leſneſs from thoſe Scriptures that he abuſeth to countenance them. Now the God and Father of lights, and fountain of ſpirits, be pleaſed to ſhew forth his ſtrength in my weakneſs, vindicate his truth denyed and darkened, guiding me ſo to examine and anſwer his Arguments and Aſſertions, as glory may be brought to his holy name, and nothing but his truth may be maintained by me. In His name and ſtrength go I forth in this buſines, beginning orderly with his Firſt book and Chapter.</p>

                        <hi>As intended by God and Chriſt, ſo he ſhews out of the Scriptures that it was to ſave that which was loſt; to ſave ſinners, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> in which he ſpeaketh the <hi>truth, though not</hi> the whole truth; that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (in other places alſo taken in) ſpeaks about this matter, as after we ſhall ſee. But to proceed: upon inquiry who theſe ſinners are, he tells us from <hi>Math.</hi> 20.28. <q>
                        <hi>that they are many, he came to give his life a ranſom for,</hi> which in other places he tells us, are <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, Believers, diſtinguiſhed from the world, Gal.</hi> 1.4. <hi>His Church. Eph.</hi> 5.25.26. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> But herein Maſter <hi>Owen</hi> dealeth not fairly, in that he tells us not (at leaſt by Scripture proveth not) that thoſe <hi>Many</hi> for whom he gave himſelf a ranſome, be bounded up in thoſe other expreſſions of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, Believers, the Church,</hi> ſo as that <hi>Many</hi> comprehends no more then in thoſe other expreſſions are included. Sure I am, the Apoſtles no where tell us that thoſe their expreſſions are interpretations of the full latitude of that <hi>Many</hi> ſpoken of by our Saviour; nor have they any where put a reſtrictive to thoſe expreſſions, as <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s</hi> only (I finde the contrary, not for ours only 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.2.) or for <hi>Believers</hi> only (for I finde alſo that he died for the unjuſt and ungodly, and bought the falſe Teachers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. and 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1.) or for his Church only (but alſo for all men, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5.6.) therefore Maſter <hi>Owen</hi> hath not delt candidly, in that he hath not given us a full expreſſion of thoſe ſinners for whom Chriſt is ſaid to give himſelf, or to come to ſave.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:117749:23"/>I think Chriſt himſelf intimates that he came to ſave the World both of believers, and not believers: elſe I ſee not the clear reaſon of that in <hi>John</hi> 12.47, <hi>If any man hear my words, and believe not, I Judg him not: for I came not to Judg the world, but to ſave the world.</hi> How his coming not to Judg the world but ſave it, if by <hi>World</hi> he mean only believers, ſhould be given as the reaſon of his not Judging him that believes not, paſſes my reaſon to conceive; therefore ſure that word <hi>World</hi> there, muſt be of a larger capacity. He hath not then given a full anſwer to his query, in that he limits the <hi>Many</hi> ſpoken of, to narrower bounds then the Scripture ever li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits it to. If he doth not interpret that many by thoſe expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s</hi> and <hi>Believers,</hi> excluſively, as to others, he ſaith nothing. But its evident he doth both by his expreſſion <hi>Diſtinguiſhed from the World</hi> (and yet Chriſt ſaith He came to ſave the <hi>World,</hi> not a part diſtinct from it only) as alſo by what he ſaith to this word <hi>Many,</hi> in <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. p. 77. where he tells us that though the <q>
                        <hi>Word</hi> Many <hi>is not in it ſelf ſufficient to reſtrain the Object of Chriſts Death unto ſome, becauſe its placed abſolutely for All,</hi> Rom. 5.19. <hi>yet thoſe Many being deſcribed in other places to be ſuch as its certain All are not, ſo its a full and evident reſtriction of it.</hi>
                     </q> But good Sir, where are thoſe places that ſo deſcribe the <hi>Many,</hi> that Chriſt gave himſelf a ranſome for, and dyed for? I hope you think not the words unjuſt, ungodly, ſinners, &amp;c. are ſuch reſtrictive words, and yet theſe are the moſt uſual deſcriptions of thoſe for whom he dyed. <q>
                        <hi>No, but he ſayes thoſe Many are the ſheep of Chriſt, the Children of God ſcattered abroad, the children that God gave him, the ſheep whereof he was ſhepherd, his Elect, his People, his Church, thoſe with whom he made a Covenant, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> but as I ſaid before, Doth any Scripture ſay, that this is the full and adaequate deſcription of thoſe <hi>Many,</hi> or doth Scripture reſtrain it unto ſuch? I ſee no one place that proves that. His anſwer then is ſtill as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfactory, as if to this, who ſhall riſe again? I ſhould anſwer, they are many that ſleep in the duſt of the earth, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.3. and then quote that in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.27. firſt Chriſt, then they that are Chriſts at his coming, and that <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. if the ſpirit of Chriſt dwell in you, he that raiſed up Jeſus, will alſo quicken our mortal bodies, and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14. <hi>He hath raiſed up the Lord, and will alſo raiſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s up by his power,</hi> and then ſay, that theſe are a deſcription of thoſe many that ſhall riſe again: ſhould I be thought ſubſtantially to prove that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:117749:23"/>
                     <hi>Many</hi> limited only to them? And yet if ſuch an anſwer would not be fair, then neither is his. If it be <hi>Objected.</hi> That other Scriptures ſay, that ſome ſhall riſe to condemnation, I anſwer that other ſcriptures ſuppoſe a poſſibility of his periſhing for whom Chriſt died, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.11. and ſay that the falſe Teachers were bought by the Lord, and yet pull upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying him that bought them, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. ſo that the arguments are alike; as is evident to any judicious impartial reader. We have nothing but Maſter <hi>Owens</hi> word, that thoſe forecited epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thites and ſentences, are the full deſcription of that <hi>Many,</hi> for whom Chriſt gave himſelf a ranſome; and thats too weak a ground to build our faith upon. That they are included in that <hi>Many,</hi> we grant, that they are all that <hi>Many</hi> that he died for, we deny and he hath not proved.</p>
                  <p>Now (not to recriminate and fling back upon himſelf that froth of wit, which in his coming to anſwer what is objected to his argument from the word <hi>Many,</hi> he caſts upon a godly, though leſs learned writer) I ſhall view his confirmations of his argument, or evaſions from objections made againſt it. The Objection mainly inſiſted on, is, that the word <hi>Many</hi> is uſed for All, and aequivalent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to All, as in <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.3. compared with <hi>John</hi> 5.29. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. <hi>To which he ſayes.</hi> 
                     <q>1. <hi>That if the proof was taken from the word Many meerly, and not from the deſcription of thoſe Many an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, with a preſuppoſed diſtinction of all men into ſeveral ſorts, by the purpoſe of God, that exception would bear ſome colour.</hi>
                     </q> So that he leans more upon his deſcription then upon the word <hi>Many;</hi> but now that deſcription, being a partial deſcription, and no where in Scripture averred to be the adaequate deſcription of thoſe <hi>Many</hi> for whom Chriſt dyed, this argument will <hi>ex confeſſo</hi> fall to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, with a following <hi>ſimile,</hi> which runs not parallel with the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument: for that diſtinction of men into ſeveral ſorts, that he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions here, we ſhall view it hereafter. 2. To <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.3. he ſayes <q>
                        <hi>that there a diſtribution of the word to the ſeveral parts of it muſt be allowed, as thus, the dead ſhall riſe, Many to life, and Many to ſhame,</hi>
                     </q> which is a meer evaſion croſſing the text, for the word <hi>Many</hi> is the <hi>Totum congregatum,</hi> and there are diſtributive particles of that whole following in the Text, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> theſe to life, and thoſe to ſhame, or ſome to life, and ſome to ſhame: beſides which he adds a groſs miſtake of the Apoſtle, as if it might be ſaid
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:117749:24"/>
                     <q>
                        <hi>Many ſhall riſe, becauſe the Apoſtle ſayes, All ſhall not dye.</hi>
                     </q> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Apoſtle no where hath ſuch a ſaying. <hi>Its not, all ſhall not dye, but, all ſhall not ſleep,</hi> which ſignifies a reſting in death, not a dying ſimply: in that ſudden change oppoſed to ſleeping, there is a death and reſurrection, though not a ſleeping in death, and reſurrection from the grave. Beſides though that were granted that All dye not, yet I hope the <hi>Many</hi> that ſleep in the grave that ſhall thence riſe,
<note place="margin">Iohn. 5.29.</note> are the ſame with, All that are in their graves ſhall come forth. All that are in their graves have dyed, and all them are called, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.2. <q>
                        <hi>Many that ſleep in the duſt.</hi> 3 To that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. he ſayes <hi>Many ſeems there to be all, but not ſpoken with an intent to denote all with an amplification, becauſe no compariſon there inſtituted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the numbers, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> But neither is there any ſtrength in that, for 1. though here he mince the matter with <hi>(ſeems to be All)</hi> yet p. 77. he confeſſeth the word <hi>Many to be placed abſolutely for All,</hi> and inſtances this place, and thats enough to my purpoſe. 2. Its plain that a compariſon is there inſtituted between Number and Number, thus far that both numbers are <hi>Many,</hi> yea and verſe. 18. the Apoſtle is as ſtrict in the words of number as in any thing elſe, As by one offence <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>All men to all men.</hi> and ſo in verſe 19. <hi>Many to many,</hi> the compariſon is in this that both have their effects upon <hi>many,</hi> as well as in the effects themſelves. Yea, and the word <hi>Many</hi> is clearly a word of amplification of both parts. The <hi>All</hi> made ſinners are truly <hi>Many,</hi> exceeding <hi>Many,</hi> and that <hi>Many All:</hi> for producing other places, in which the word <hi>Many</hi> is <hi>All,</hi> though it be a trivial buſineſs, in which only the Author that he bends himſelf againſt is challenged, yet becauſe he is confident that there is no other, I ſhall with the Authors leave and his, propound one or two to conſideration; as that in <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.36. Return O Lord to the many thouſands in Iſrael, is to <hi>All</hi> the thouſands of Iſrael, and not to many of thoſe thouſands only: ſo <hi>Mic.</hi> 4.4. <hi>He ſhall Judg among many Nations,</hi> is among all Nations, for other Scriptures ſay, The Lord ſhall be one and his name one in <hi>All</hi> the earth, and he ſhall judge the World in Righteouſnes, and <hi>All</hi> Nation ſhall glorify him: But to return to the firſt Chapter, in which thoſe expreſſions of the end of Chriſts coming, that is, to ſave ſinners, &amp;c. are good and approved by us as the word of God. But how he underſtands this word <hi>Saved,</hi> or how this phraſe of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:117749:24"/>to ſave, he doth not fully expreſs: to ſupply which defect I ſhall conſider them a little, And</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the word <hi>Save,</hi> its of a large ſignification in Scripture when its attributed to God and Chriſt, as,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It ſignifies to preſerve or keep life, yea, when it is forfeited by our ſin, and God might juſtly deprive us of it, to keep out of periſhing, as in <hi>Luke</hi> 9.56. <hi>The Son of Man came not to deſtroy mens lives</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) <hi>but to ſave them.</hi> Truly I conceive that in the day that <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned, he forfeited his ſoul or life, and in his own ours alſo, who were vertually in him, and had God ſtrictly taken the forfeiture of him, He, and we all in him, had in that very day forthwith periſhed: but Chriſt who was fore ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to this buſineſs, ſtept in between God and man, and by way of ingagement became the dead Man, the Lamb ſlain for us, and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved his ſoul and ours alſo; and ſo he yet as Mediator between God and us, preſerves us from many deaths, being patient toward us, when our follies deſerve them to come upon us,
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.15.</note> in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard his forbearance is to be accounted Salvation by us. And ſo when the <hi>Samaritans</hi> brutiſhly rejecting him, had deſerved ſuch a deſtruction as the Diſciples would have called for upon them, Chriſt tells them No, he came to <hi>Save</hi> mens lives even from ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved deſtructions alſo, not to deſtory them in them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To <hi>Save</hi> is ſometime further to pull and deliver out of the ſtate of ignorance, blindneſs, and corruption that men naturally lie in, and ſo its uſed in <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. ſaved us by the waſhing of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Sometimes to preſerve a man in that <hi>Saved eſtate,</hi> or in that grace of God, to which the ſoul through the call of God is brought, as in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.2, 3. by which ye are ſaved, if ye keep in minde how I have declared them to you: and ſo in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16. in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in them (in the words of Chriſt, thou ſhalt <hi>Save,</hi> that is, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve (from falling) thy ſelf and them that hear thee. Again ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To <hi>Save,</hi> is ultimately to deliver from, and out of all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, fears and miſeries, and to bring to everlaſting Glory. And thats the utmoſt and higheſt act of ſaving, the obtaining the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is in Chriſt with eternal Glory, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.10.</p>
                  <p>Now in which of theſe ſenſes Chriſt came to ſave the loſt and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, or whether he came to ſave each of them, that he came for,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:117749:25"/>in All of them, he declareth not, but ſo far as I perceive he takes it as including all together; and intends this propoſition for a truth, that whoſoever Chriſt came to dye for, them he came to ſave in all theſe acts of ſaving, but then he neither proves that propoſition ſo univerſally propounded, but only brings ſome ſcriptures which ſay, he came to ſave ſinners, to waſh and purge his Church, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s,</hi> believers, &amp;c. not proving them to be the whole adaequate object of his Death, as was before noted: nor doth he tell us how we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the phraſe of <hi>Coming to ſave,</hi> which in the ſecond place, we ſhall briefly ſpeak to: for thereby we are to underſtand,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Either that God ſent him, and he came forth to bring abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and effectually, all and every ſinner, for and to whom he came, and for whom he dyed, to Salvation in its higheſt acts, or to the utmoſt Salvation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Or elſe that he came from God with the authority and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Saviour, to reveal that to men, and do that in dying for men, by which they liſtening to him ſhould be ſaved, but rejecting him they may miſs of that exerciſe of his office, and work of ſaving, which they otherwiſe might have from him. Indeed in the firſt ſenſe, the ſeries and drift of his diſcource argues that he takes it; but the latter ſenſe ſeemes to be as agreeable to Scripture, which ſaith that he would have gathered them, and they would not. They would not come unto him, that they might have life, that he is the bread of God, that came down from heaven, and gives life to the world, the true bread that God gave to the murmuring <hi>Jews,</hi> who yet not eating him, have not life in them. All which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions argue an authority and office given to Chriſt, to ſave and give life to men, and his readineſs to give it; though they alſo ſhew that the execution of that office, or rather its fulfilling in men is ſuſpended, and takes not its effect towards thoſe that refuſe to come to him and ſubmit to his order, preſcribed for executing it on them. Such a phraſe we have in <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.8. <hi>I am come down to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of the land into a good land and a large, &amp;c.</hi> in which his meaning can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, that he came with an abſolute intent and purpoſe to bring all that his people certainly and effectually out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> into <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan;</hi> but there was an implicit condition couched in it, of their hearkning to him and following him, otherwiſe though he came down to bring them into <hi>Canaan,</hi> many might never come into
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:117749:25"/>as the event alſo proved it. Now if thus we take thoſe Scriptures of his coming to ſave ſinners, and that that was loſt; then though we underſtand the word <hi>Save,</hi> to comprehend all thoſe foremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed acts, it will be little to the Authors advantage. But I paſs from this part of his conſideration to the next, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>2 <hi>The effect and actual product of the work it ſelf, the thing effected and accompliſhed by the Death, Oblation and blood-ſhedding of Jeſus Chriſt, which he expreſſes more diſtinctly to be Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Juſtification, Sanctification, Adoption, Glory and Immortality;</hi>
                     </q> for which he produces divers Scriptures, ſome pertinent, ſome not. Now to this part we ſhall grant, that by the death of Jeſus Chriſt ſome men attain to all theſe things, which is as much as thoſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures produced by him prove. But I ſhall briefly declare how they are by his Death.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. His Death and bloudſhedding was that way through which God went to effect theſe things, and ſo <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> may be tranſlated [through his Death] as Gods dividing the red ſea was part of that way by which he brought <hi>Iſrael</hi> into <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the ordering <hi>Joſeph</hi> to priſon, was the way through which God brought him to his preferment in Pharaohs Court, and made proviſion for the people of thoſe countries in the 7 years of famine. <hi>Davids</hi> fight with <hi>Goliah,</hi> was the way through which the Iſraelites were victorious over the Philiſtins, &amp;c. Had not Chriſt died we had not been reconciled, juſtified, ſanctified, received the adoption of ſons, and ſo not glorified: by that our ſin was expiated the way between God and us cleared and made open, Redemption ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: ſalvation is in Chriſt for us, ſo as that by believing in his Name any may be ſaved. <hi>Acts</hi> 4.11, 12.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By his Death we are Reconciled, Juſtified, Sanctified, made Sons, &amp;c. as its the way through which diſcovered to us, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in by us, we are brought to union with Chriſt, and to receive that ſalvation and redemption that is in him: not that Chriſt in the act of his dying, made us at one with God, and ſo reconciled us to God in our ſelves, or juſtified, or ſanctified us, made us ſons and glorified us in our perſons. But this death of his made known to us in the Goſpel, is that by which God draws us to his Son, and to himſelf, and ſo its it by which he reconciles us. Thence the <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſſians</hi> are ſaid Now to be reconciled, ſince the enmity in their minds was ſlain by him: and ſo, reconciled by his death, is a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:117749:26"/>phraſe like thoſe in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. and 3.20. begotten to a lively hope by the reſurrection of Chriſt, from the dead, and ſo the conſcience gives a good anſwer by his reſurrection, that is, by it as not only acted in Chriſt, but as diſcovered to us in the word, and as its that <hi>medium</hi> by which we behold Gods goodneſs toward us.
<note place="margin">Rom. 3.25. and 5.1.</note> And ſo the bloud of Chriſt Juſtifies us by faith in it, as by vertue of the ſatisfaction made by it Chriſt preſents us righteous, being brought into him through the faith of it: and ſo for ſanctification, it's by his bloud ſprinkled on us, and through the power of the ſpirit working powerfully in us. That place in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. quoted by him p. 64. to prove ſanctification to be an immediate product of his death, is horribly miſtake; for it ſpeaks not of his Death ſimply asſuffered, or his blood as preſented by him to God, but as ſprinkled upon the conſcience, and therefore its brought to anſwer the type of the red heifer <hi>Numb.</hi> 19. which not by its death and oblation imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſanctified the people, but the aſhes of it being reſerved, and after mixed with clean water, and ſprinkled on the unclean, then Sanctified, to the purifying of the fleſh; and not otherwiſe: ſo alſo he hath miſapplyed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. in his firſt chapter, p. 2. bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to prove Reconciliation accompliſhed in the Death of Chriſt. When the Apoſtle ſpeaks but of it in <hi>fieri</hi> not in <hi>facto,</hi> its <gap reason="foreign">

Again he there miſquotes <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. rendring it We have all ſinned, and are juſtified, as if it were <gap reason="foreign">

                     <q>
                        <hi>That which the Father and Son intend to accompliſh, in and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all thoſe for whom Chriſt died, by his death that is moſt certainly effected. But the Father and Son intended by the Death of Chriſt to redeem, purge, ſanctifie, purifie, deliver from Death, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, the curſe of the Law, to quit of all ſin, to make righteouſneſs in Chriſt all thoſe for whom he dyed. Therefore He dyed for all, and only thoſe in and towards whom, all thoſe things recounted are effected, and ſo not for All.</hi>
                     </q> This is a main pillar of his edifice: let us by Gods aſſiſtance aſſay to ſhake and evert it.</p>
                  <p>And firſt (not to ſpeak to the form, how the concluſion ſhould have been inferred) for the <hi>major,</hi> if taken in this ſenſe, What the Father and Son did intend, purpoſe, and wholly take upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, abſolutely to do by his death, that was and ſhall be thereby effected, His determinate purpoſe ſhall not fail; ſo its granted. But if by <hi>intended,</hi> we underſtand what he propoundeth as an end intended in which there may be ſomething ſuſpended in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition upon ſome condition, in that way I ſay what ever is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded as his intent, may not be fulfilled and accompliſhed in All for whom he dyed. But I know he intends it in the former ſenſe: and therefore (2. I ſhall deny the Minor, and deſire his proof for it, namely that the Father and Son intended, that is, abſolutely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and wholly took upon themſelves, without condition, to redeem, purge, ſanctify &amp;c. all for whom Chriſt died. For</p>

                  <p n="3">3. None of all the Places quoted, prove what is affirmed: for either they ſay not that the object named is all that Chriſt died for, but ſome ſpecially diſtinguiſhed from others, by the intervention of faith either, in the eye of God, or in real exiſtence in them, as his people,
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.10.</note> them that believe on him, the Church, that is, a people called out of the world, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s,</hi> who were then actually believers; them that were given him out of the <hi>World,</hi> had received his words, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, were ſent into the world by him to preach the Goſpel (to ſay nothing of his begging the queſtion, that by ſanctifying himſelf he meanes his dying, or ſetting himſelf apart to dye, in <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.19.) ſo that that <hi>Minor</hi> is peccant in that it wants proof, none of thoſe Scriptures ſaying, that thoſe things he aymed at in all he dyed for. To illuſtrate the buſineſs, the proof is like this. It pleaſed God by the fooliſhneſs of preaching to ſave them that believe; and he called you by the Goſpel to the obtaining of the Glory of the Lord Jeſus; <hi>Ergo</hi> All to whom it pleaſed God that the Goſpel ſhould be preached, ſhall be ſaved and obtain eternal Glory. To propound as a truth that God intended to redeem, purge, and ſave All for whom Chriſt dyed, and then to prove it by telling us he intended to do ſo to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s</hi> that believe, to his Church and people; is as lame a proof as if I ſhould propound for truth, that God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to bring into <hi>Canaan</hi> all that he brought out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and then prove it by ſhewing that he ſo intended to all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved and followed him. Or elſe</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thoſe places ſhow not that thoſe things ſo mentioned, were the abſolute intentions of God and Chriſt, taken upon themſelves to be effected by them, without ſuſpending them upon condition in us, and if the Minor take not the word <hi>intended</hi> in that ſenſe, it ſuits not with the Major, but contains a <hi>quartus terminus:</hi> and the major not ſo taken is untrue. If it be ſaid the words are, I came to ſave that that's loſt, he gave himſelf that he might purge <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s,</hi> and ſuffered for the unjuſt, to bring us to God, &amp;c. and where things are ſo ſpoken of, as the ends and aimes of God in acting; there, though we have not the expreſſions, He intended this and that; yet we are to underſtand that God, abſolutely intended to accompliſh
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:117749:27"/>and bring about thoſe things, and ſo that all thoſe that are the object of thoſe acts which were acted to ſuch an end, obtained or ſhall obtain that end. Then I deny it and will prove it, that in ſuch ſpeeches where two acts are mentioned as end and means, and God the agent in the act directed to ſuch an end, it is not ſafe to ſay, that alwayes that act propounded as the end, in his acting, was abſolutely intended to be, and anſwerably is brought about by him, in all thoſe upon whom or for whom he acted that act thats mentioned as the means: as to inſtance. <hi>Act.</hi> 17, 26, 27. <hi>He made of one bloud all the kinde of men to inhabit all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times appointed, and the bounds of their habitation, that they might ſeek the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Here is end and means propounded, the making all of one bloud, bounding their times &amp; habitations, the means directed to this end, that they might ſeek the Lord. Will any man hence ſay, that God abſolutely intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he would cauſe all that he made, and whoſe times and habitations he bounded, to ſeek him, and who ever ſeek him not, and ſo call thoſe in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.11. were not made by him? So <hi>John</hi> 1.6, 7. <hi>John was ſent to bear witneſs to the light, that all through him might believe.</hi> Doth it follow that becauſe that was the end propounded, therefore God abſolutely purpoſed to make all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, to whom he bare witneſs, and ſo its true that he bare witneſs to none elſe? is not that contrary to <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.16, 17, 18. and 21.32. So <hi>John</hi> 5.34. Chriſt tels the cavilling <hi>Jews</hi> that he ſpake thoſe things to them that they might be ſaved; will it follow that it was his abſolute intent that they ſhould all be ſaved, hear him or not? or to make all hear him and be ſaved, even thoſe that would not come to him that they might live? verſ. 40. Chriſt came to ſave that which was loſt: Doth it follow that he abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determined to bring all them to eternal life to whom he came? even thoſe alſo to whom he came, and they received him not? <hi>John</hi> 1.11. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.33, 34. He brought his choſen into <hi>Canaan,</hi> that they might obſerve his Statutes and keep his Laws. Therefore he intended to make them all do ſo, and all that he brought into that land did ſo, contrary to <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.34, 35, 36. And to ſay no more, God came down to bring <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> to bring them into <hi>Canaan.

                        <hi>that the things before recounted are the immediate fruits and products of Chriſts Death, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Reconciliation, Juſtification, Sanctification, Adoption, Glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:</hi>
                     </q> which is as true as that the diſpoſſeſſing the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and the giving their Land to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> was the immediate fruit and product of their bringing out of <hi>Egypt</hi> over the red Sea; as may be ſeen by what we ſayed to them p. 10. No one of thoſe things as accompliſhed in men, is the <hi>immediate fruit</hi> and product of his Death. Not Reconciliation, though that be by the Death of Chriſt, yet not <hi>immediately,</hi> there is requiſite to it beſide Chriſts death the word of Reconciliation to declare it, and that heard and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to, as is plain, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19, 20. We beſeech you be ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God; yea and all theſe things come between the death of Chriſt and Reconciliation, and are mediums of it. Juſtification is not the immediate fruit and product of his death, but <hi>mediante fide,</hi> We are juſtified by faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. thence, we have believed that we might be Juſtified. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. and that preſuppoſes the word and ſpirit opening the death of Chriſt, and ſhedding abroad the love of God; and ſprinkling the bloud of Chriſt upon the ſoul, as in <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5, 6, 7. <hi>He ſhed on us the Spirit abundantly, that being juſtified by his Grace we might be made heires, &amp;c</hi> ſo 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. <hi>ye are Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Name of the Lord, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi> Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is not the <hi>immediate</hi> fruit and product of Chriſts Death but <hi>mediante fide</hi> too; Sanctified by faith that is in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Acts.</hi> 26.18. and ſo there intervenes the being called out of the world

                  <p>THe ſecond Chapter being only ſpeculation about the nature of end and means,
<note place="margin">To Chap. 2.</note> and not at all applyed there to the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I ſhall paſs over; only noting a miſtake in that expreſſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the nature of Moral means, which he hath pag. 6. line 15, 16. <q>
                        <hi>that in a moral ſenſe, when the action and the end are to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in reference to a Moral rule or law preſcribed to the agent, then the means are the Deſerving or Meritorious cauſe of the end.</hi>
                     </q> Which I conceive to be falſe, looking upon Moral as contradiſtinct to Phyſical or natural, as there he doth, for it would then follow that Faith as a means conſidered in reference to the Law of Faith, ſhould be the Meritorious cauſe of its end, that is, Juſtification and Salvation, and ſo good works: which I think All Orthodox and Proteſtant Divines do utterly diſclaim. Though Faith be the way to juſtification and eternall life, yet its no wayes the meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cauſe; otherwiſe we ſhould be juſtified not only <hi>per fidem,</hi> but <hi>propter fidem</hi> too, not <hi>ex gratiâ</hi> but <hi>ex debito &amp; merito;</hi> and ſo that diſtinction of the Apoſtle in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.2, 3, 4. is quite overthrown, but no more to that, it being but by the by.</p>
                  <p>His third chapter is ſpent about the conſideration of God as the agent in the work of Redemption;
<note place="margin">To his 3. Chap.</note> about which there is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs difference between us as to the main, only a few expreſſions drop by the by, that are conſiderable, as That 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. <q>
                        <hi>[who is the Saviour of all men, chiefly of them that believe] calls not God a Saviour with reference to his Redeeming us by Chriſt,</hi>
                     </q> but his ſaving and preſerving all by his providence: A ſtrange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:117749:29"/>in which <hi>opponit non opponenda;</hi> for though its true he ſayes <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s</hi> by his providence, yet that that providence of his is ſaving to ſinners, yea ſo much as in this life, without reſpect had to the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Chriſt, much leſs that its ſo ſaving, ſpecially to believers, as that it becomes the motive and ground to them, of ſuch truſt in God,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.17, 18. and 5.1.13, 14. Phil. 3.20, 1.</note> as carries them out to ſuffer and labour in his Goſpel (as there its affirmed to be) is unreaſonable to conceive; and it diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with what he ſayes to this buſineſs in other places, where he tells us, it was eying God as one that had prepared things not ſeen, eternal in the heavens for them, and eying Chriſts death for All that they might live to him, and glorifying his love therein, to his and his brethrens hearts; expecting a ſaviour from heaven to change their vile bodies, that made them deſpiſe their lives and liberties, preach the Goſpel through ſufferings, reproaches, croſſes, how ever little eſteemed as beſide themſelves. Now here to think the Apoſtle cuts off all that conſideration of his ſaving, and only pitches upon him as a providential Saviour in a ſalvation out of Chriſt, or without the conſideration of Chriſt intervening, as the lovely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Truſt and Confidence in all their labor and afflictions, is too jejune and erronious: but we ſhall meet with this again in his eighth chapter.</p>
                  <p>Again in conſidering the obligation and Covenant between God and Chriſt, he promiſes ſomething that will utterly overthrow the Univerſal Redemption, but defers it to another after-place in <hi>lib.</hi> 3. chap. 1. where we ſhall meet with, it and give it its anſwer: only whereas he tells us p. 16. <hi>that the promiſe in</hi> Iſa. 53.11. <q>
                        <hi>is inconſiſtent with their perſwaſion who in termes have affirmed, That the Death of Chriſt might have had its full and utmoſt effect, and yet none be ſaved.</hi>
                     </q> To that I ſhall ſay how I conceive that may be affirmed and how not (not ſtanding here upon it that that in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11. is a propheſie of, but not a promiſe uttered to Chriſt)</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It might have been ſo, <hi>ſuppoſito quod Deus eam aliter ordinaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet;</hi> as it might have been undertaken and indured, and as God might have decreed, it might have been ſo.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To look upon it as it was indured, and take it by it ſelf, ſimply as Death; though to ſuch and ſuch ends without Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from which it is diſtinct, then alſo it might have been ſo: had he not riſen too, all its effect would not have ſaved any man: So the Apoſtle intimates, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.14, 16, 17.</p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:117749:29"/>
                  <p n="3">3. It might have had its full effect as only offered to God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out application to men, and none ſaved; had it been its end intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it had been contrary to that in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.11. but the effect and end of a thing differs much; The Carpenter builds a houſe, the effect of his work is the houſe it ſelf, the end of its building, habitation: the end of Chriſts Death is, that men might be ſaved by him, the effect of it as a thing ſimply done by him, between God and him, is not the ſalvation of any one without application of it, or diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of ſpirit to men through it; ſo that had Chriſt died, and roſe too, and done no more, none had been ſaved to the utmoſt, except the buſineſs of his Prieſthood be in vain, and a thing that might have been ſpared'; ſo that its effect it might have had as a thing endured by him, and none ſaved, as they take ſaving in that high.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But to ſay the thing that God aimed at, and that was cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted to be granted to Chriſt upon, or as a reward of his Death, might have been effected or performed, and yet none ſaved; is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed cleerly falſe, nor did the ſpeech oppoſed affirm ſo much; but thats as much, I ſuppoſe, as upon (ſecond thoughts) he aimed at. eſt act.</p>

                        <hi>That the pleaſure of the Lord that was to proſper in the hand of Chriſt, was the bringing of many ſons to glory;</hi>
                     </q> thats a truth but whether it be all the truth or no he tells us not, and ſo deals not ſo fully and plainly as he ſhould; whether the glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God in the convincing, and juſt and righteous judging of the reſt be not the pleaſure of the Lord too, he ſaith nothing, much leſs diſproves it, and yet I think he ſhall do that, and the pleaſure of the Lord too in that matter ſhall proſper in his hand.</p>

                     <q>In the ſame <hi>pag.</hi> he tells us the requeſt of our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 17. was neither for more nor leſs then God had ingaged himſelf to him for, and that was for a full confluence of the love of God, and the fruits of that love upon all his Elect, in Faith, Sanctification and Glory:</q> But of that he gives us no proof, neither that there he asked no leſs (for as for more I will not queſtion) nor that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted Faith for all his Elect, or any of them. To the firſt. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to him, Whether the ſalvation of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> &amp;c. was not in the Covenant made between God and Chriſt? if not, then ſome more are ſaved then were included in that Covenant: If yes, then I demand, what paſſage in that Prayer requeſts that they might believe and be ſanctified? if none, then he asked leſs in that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:117749:30"/>Prayer then God had ingaged himſelf to him for. To the ſecond, I deſire him to ſhew in what paſſage he prayes for the faith of the Elect in all that Prayer: not from the ſixth to the twentieth, for he tells his Father they had it already, and I ſuppoſe he will not be able to prove that he prayed to his Father there to give them that which they had before that prayer, at leaſt in that degree in which they had it; nor in <hi>ver.</hi> 20. for them he ſuppoſeth as future believers, as he makes them the <hi>ſuppoſitum</hi> of his prayer; his prayer is not, that they might believe, but that believing, which he ſuppoſeth they ſhould, they might be one, <hi>viz</hi> in body, priviledg, and injoyment of the grace of God in Chriſt; except he will ſay Faith is prayed for in <hi>ver.</hi> 21. and 23. when he ſaith, <hi>that the world might believe;</hi> but firſt, that's for the world, not for the Elect; ſecondly, that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf denies to be the faith of the Elect, and ſo the fruit of that love <q>here ſaid to appertain to the Elect, but only a conviction, not for any good of the world, but onely for the vindication of his people,</q> 
                     <hi>cha</hi> 7. <hi>pag.</hi> 47. therefore I deſire him to ſhew me in what place of that prayer, that Faith he here ſpeaks of, as a fruit of Gods electing love, is prayed for.</p>

                        <hi>That God impoſed his wrath due unto, and Chriſt underwent the pains of hell for, either all the ſins of all men, or all the ſins of ſome men, or ſome ſins of all men: If the laſt, then all have ſome ſins to anſwer for, and ſo no man ſhall be ſaved; if the ſecond, then that is it he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms; if the firſt, then all ſhould be ſaved, or why not?</hi>
                     </q> This may ſeem at the firſt view ſuch a three-headed Monſter as that there is no conquering it; but through Gods aſſiſtance we ſhall grapple with it. About his ſuffering the pains of hell, I ſhall not queſtion with him; its an ambiguous word, and variouſly uſed; And as no Scripture uſes his expreſsions, perhaps in his intention, ſo as the Scripture uſes the word hell, I have no ground from Scripture to deny the expreſsion: therefore to the thing it ſelf,</p>
                  <p>I may ſay, that in ſeverall reſpects, all thoſe three branches of the Dilemma are true, and yet his conſequences will not follow. As,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He underwent the wrath of God for ſome fins of all men,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.6. Rom. 5.18.</note> elſe he could not give himſelf a ranſom for them all, nor his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs come to All men to juſtification of life, nor any favor of God be extended to them, except he interpoſed between God and that ſin that in its deſert, and by Gods ſentence of death, ſtopt the paſſage of all good flowing upon them, unleſs hindred by mediation. But then he ſays, All have ſome ſins to anſwer for, <hi>Nego conſequentiam,</hi> that follows not for he that bears ſome ſins of all, may yet bear alſo all of ſome, thoſe two are not inconſiſtent: had he ſaid, But ſome ſins of any, that had excluded All of any; but ſome of All doth not: thoſe that may be but ſome of one mans ſins may be All of another; as ſuppoſe he bare all ſins <hi>in genere,</hi> but the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, he then bare all ſome mens ſins,
<note place="margin">Heb. 10.26.</note> for ſome men are not guilty of that, but are kept from it: but yet in reſpect of their ſins that run into that, he bare but ſome of their ſins, not all as ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He underwent the wrath of God for all the ſins of ſome, that is, gave ſuch ſatisfaction to his juſtice, that no ſin they have ſhall be their condemnation, namely of thoſe that believe and walk in the light with him, as it is 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. otherwiſe the phraſe as he expreſſes it, the Scripture hath not: But then thats it he faith. No ſure, for he ſays he bare only All the ſins of ſome men, and dyed for
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:117749:31"/>none elſe but thoſe ſome, but ſo neither the Scriptures nor we ſay: He might bear the puniſhment of all the ſins of ſome men, and yet not them only.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He underwent the wrath of God for all the ſins of All men in ſome ſenſe conſidered, That is, as they were ſinners in his firſt ſtepping in to undertake for men, as ſin was upon them through the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and bound them to curſe and death, and ſo they needed a mediator, or elſe they muſt preſently be cut off and periſh; and ſo in a conſideration and view of them as previous to his ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in to mediate. And his bearing all of them was enough to ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome them all from that firſt condemning ſentence: and yet neither follows it ſo that all muſt then be eternally ſaved, becauſe there are other ſins againſt his mediation, and the fruits of it extended to them, as conſidered in a condition conſequent thereto: as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing the light, and abuſing the power and liberty given them in the ſtrivings and operations of his grace and ſpirit, a turning away from him that did ſo much for them, a denying him that bought them, not believing on his name, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But then he ſays further, <q>
                        <hi>If this unbelief be a ſin, then Chriſt underwent the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it or not, if he did, then why muſt that hinder more then other ſins?</hi> &amp;c.</q> To which I anſwer, that though properly and moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly thoſe ſins and evils came upon him, into which the fall of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> plunged us, ſins not againſt him as Mediator, or God as giving a Mediator and dealing with us there-through, which was conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to the fall and to mans ſinning: yet inaſmuch as God knew that which they would do againſt his Mediating for them, he not only laid upon him that ſin previous to it with its proper operations in that way, but alſo provided in that his Death againſt other ſins that would follow, ſo as that he might be perfectly able to ſave to the utmoſt any that ſhould come to God by him. And ſo he did ſo much in that one Death and offering, as by virtue thereof, patience and forbearance might be afforded for ſome ſpace to the Rebellious, while God is ſtriving with them by his Spirit, and leading them to Repentance.

                     <q>IN his fourth Chapter he tels us how Chriſt was Agent in the work of Redemption by voluntary ſuſception of the office im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on him, and ſo was incarnate, and offered up himſelf a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to God,</q> which we affirme alſo; only ſome of the Scriptures that he quotes for this (though they intimate his ſuffering and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) yet ſpeak to a further buſineſs, as the waſhing us in his blood, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5. is in the ſprinkling his blood upon our conſciences, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.26. ſo the ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.19. is not his yeelding up himſelf to death fure (or not that only) that they might be yeelded up to death by his death: but the devoting himſelf to God, to receive and make known the knowledg of God to them, that they might be ſanctified, and ſet apart through the truth to that miniſtration to which he ſent them; for neither ſpeaks he there of all the Elect (except Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> think that all the Elect are ſent to miniſter to the world,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 18.</note> as Chriſt was) but of thoſe actual believers whom he ſent into the world;
<note place="margin">verſe 4.</note> for he makes this prayer, as one that had finiſhed the work that God gave him to do on earth, and as one committing the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Father toward the world, in point of miniſtration unto others fitted for it; even as <hi>Paul</hi> prayed for the Elders of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> when he was leaving them and the flock of God to them, <hi>Asts.</hi> 20. but to paſſe that: Beſides thoſe other two acts of his undertaking, <hi>Incarnation</hi> and <hi>Oblation,</hi> he mentions alſo a third, <hi>viz. Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,</hi> which we grant alſo; but whereas he ſays, <q>Its for all and every one of thoſe for whom he gave himſelf as an oblation, he did
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:117749:32"/>not ſuffer, and then refuſe to intercede for them, do the greater, and omit the leſs;</q> that poſition, though I will not peremptorily deny it, yet as Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> by Interceſſion means and takes in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion as the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or Advocate in this aſſertion, ſo I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he will not prove it by Scripture. And yet no need of ſaying he refuſed to do it for them, it will be difficult I ſuppoſe for him to prove, that the wiſdom of God did ſee it meet to impoſe that upon him, ſo to intercede for all that he dyed for. And if it was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to him, though he do it not, yet may he not be ſaid either to refuſe or omit it. It becomes us to believe what God hath declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not to deliver for truths or impoſitions of God, what our fancies conceive he muſt have impoſed, where he hath declared no ſuch impoſition: he hath ſaid Chriſt dyed for all; but where he ſaith, he makes interceſſion for all, or for all he dyed for, I leave to Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> to finde, and I would he would remember his own language in the Preface. <q>
                        <hi>To honor God and Chriſt in his own language, or elſe be for ever ſilent, and that our inventions, be they never ſo ſplendid (and I add rational too) in our eyes, yet to him they are abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</hi>
                     </q> God doth not act alwayes according to our rules, do the leſſer where he hath done the greater, but may ſuſpend the leſſer upon condition, if it ſo pleaſe him; as he doth not alway ſupply with bread, and keep from periſhing by famine him that he hath given life to, though the life be more then food; and a man that believes and walks in Gods ways, may reaſon affirmatively, as our Saviour inſtructs us, <hi>Math.</hi> 6.25. but let us view his pretended proofes of it from Scripture.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.8. <q>
                        <hi>Ask of me, and I will give thee the Heathen for thine inheritance, and the utmoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> &amp;c.</q> But doth that ſay, That Chriſt ſhould make interceſſion for all he died for? no ſuch matter; nor is there a word about iner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding for any, but that they ſhould be given him as his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and poſſeſſion; and if that be his interceſſion there, then its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to all elect and others, the Nations and the utmoſt parts of the earth; not an elect people onely, but even thoſe that he ſhould rule with an iron rod, and break in pieces as a Potters veſſel. I hope Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> thinks not (at leaſt will not prove) that God rules his Church, <hi>Tam duro imperio,</hi> ſo as to break them in pieces as a Potters veſſel, &amp; make them unprofitable, or that he rules them onely ſo; nor I ſuppoſe upon ſecond thoughts, will he ſay, that the next place that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:117749:33"/>"he quotes, <hi>viz. Joh.</hi> 14.2. <hi>I go to prepare a place for you,</hi> is either a good expoſition of that in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.8 as if his going to prepare a place for his Diſciples, was asking them for his inheritance, to rule them with an iron rod, or proves that he went to entercede for all he "died for: nor doth <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.7. ſay any thing to that purpoſe, but that the high Prieſt went into the ſecond Tabernacle once a year with the blood that he offered for the ignorances of the people; nor ſayes, "<hi>ver.</hi> 24. That Chriſt appears in the preſence of God, to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede for All that he died for, much leſs as an Advocate, and as the Apoſtles ſpeak of his interceſſion with reference to believers. "The 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1, 2. (which he nextly quotes) extends his Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion beyond his Advocation, and doth not ſpeak of the one as largely as the other; Minde the words, <hi>We have an advocate, and he is the propitiation for our ſins;</hi> I hope the <hi>Our</hi> there is as large as the <hi>We,</hi> of whom he had ſaid, <hi>We have an advocate,</hi> that <hi>[Our]</hi> being a repetition of, and ſo the ſame with the former <hi>[We]</hi> but now ſee his Propitiation expreſly extended further, <hi>And not for our ſins onely, but alſo for the whole worlds:</hi> ſo that that makes more againſt his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion then for it. Its true, that his Advocation (as he ſaies) is founded upon his propitiation, and may be found in exerciſe for the ſame perſons as there is proved, We have an Advocate who is the propitiation for our ſins; but that the Advocation muſt therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to all the ſame perſons that the propitiation reaches to, is a fond inference, like this, A Prince by his favor with a King, and by his own great coſt and charge, mediating for twenty men condemned forfelony, gets a pardon for them all; therefore when afterwards ten of them love and honor him, yet have their failings, and the other ten openly rebell againſt him ſtill, and reject his love; he muſt keep them all ſtill in the Kings ſpecial favor if he keep any of them therein. The roof of the houſe and every particular Chamber of it, is built upon and upheld by the foundation, therefore every Chamber muſt be every way as large as it, ſo that hitherto this Aſſertion wants proof of Scripture.</p>
                  <p>"That of <hi>John</hi> 17.9. proves it not neither, for that ſaies, <hi>I pray not for the world,</hi> but the Scripture ſaies, <hi>God was in him reconciling the world,</hi> and that he came to ſave the world; and indeed good reaſon, for his not praying as there for the world, whether the Elect in purpoſe and fore-knowledg or not, for his requeſts there are onely for things conſequent to faith, as Union, Preſervation in Faith, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:117749:33"/>and Glorification, and therefore meet to be put up for none but men called out, or viewed as called out, of the ſtate and fellowſhip of the world; that in <hi>ver.</hi> 20. though its for perſons as then of the world, yet as ſuch they are not there the object of his prayer, but as ſuppoſed in an after-believing ſtate; even as when a King grants to the Mayor of a Corporation the honor of having a Sword or the like born before him, and ſaies, neither give I this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to thee onely, but to all ſucceeding Mayors of this Corporation alſo, and to none elſe; the ſubject of that Grant, is a Mayor as a Mayor of that Corporation; though in ſaying ſuch as ſhall be Mayors, its plain the Grant reaches to perſons as are then that not ſo, perhaps then not born, and yet the expreſſion is true, that its given to none but the Mayor of that Corporation, for they that after ſhall be Mayors, and now are not, are not the ſubject of that Grant, as now unborn or unfree, but as after they come to be made Mayors; ſo here, they that are of the world now, may come to be ſuch perſons as there are prayed for, and yet the world, as, and while the world, wholly excluded from being the ſubject to whom thoſe poſtulataes are deſired to be given. And to Mr. <hi>Owens</hi> ſaying, <q>that the world there is oppoſite to the Elect</q> (except by Elect he mean, men <gap reason="foreign">

Either that he intercedes for All he dyed for, or that if he do, they are all ſaved e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally. Its true indeed (as he after ſaith) <q>He is able to ſave to the utmoſt all that come to God by him, becauſe he ever liveth to to make interceſſion for them;</q> but neither proves that he makes interceſſion for all that he dyed for, nor that whoſoever he makes Interceſſion for, he makes it for them for ever, and they ſhalbe ſaved to the utmoſt. The Fig-tree notwithſtanding that interceſſion made for patience and means of grace, yet not coming to God by him, might be cut down. It ſays not all that he goeth to God for any thing, for ſhall be ſaved to the utmoſt: but he is able to ſave to the utmoſt all that come to God by him, becauſe he ever lives to make interceſſion for them. He is able to ſave them to the utmoſt by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that powerful office, but if men come not to God by him, or withdraw from him, he ſays not that he lives for ever to execute his office for them, and to ſave them to the utmoſt. Indeed from this his office and interceſſion founded on his oblation, believers (men that come to God by him) have notable confidence as is expreſſed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34, (another place quoted by him) even as <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhuah</hi> whoſe ſpirits were right with God, had notable confidence (from the great things God had done for them and his preſence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them) to poſſeſs the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> and ſubdue their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.9. and yet it was not therefore a truth that all that God had done thoſe mighty things for, and was walking amongſt, either had that confidence, or their ſucceſs; which being conſidered keeps alive the <hi>General Ranſom</hi> from that <hi>break neck</hi> with which Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> threatneth it; for though its true that thoſe for whom he dyed, hearing and believing his love to them, have no cauſe but to truſt in him, and ſeek and hope for great things from him, as all the Iſraelites that came over the red Sea and ſee Gods mighty works for for them, had no cauſe but to have believed in God as well as the reſt, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.11. yet as there all that ſhared in thoſe great things did not ſo believe as ſome, nor had the like iſſue, but many through their unbelief ſell ſhort of <hi>Canaan;</hi> ſo here many not believing the goodneſs of God to them (for which in part many may thank their Miniſters that leave them to ſeek whether they have a mediator ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of God for them or not) do not believe in Chriſt, and ſo for not believing and by not believing, periſh; for the Apoſtle ſaith
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:117749:34"/>not that All that Chriſt dyed and roſe for, he intercedes for; nor that all that he intercedes for ſhall be ſaved and have no condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; no more then <hi>Caleb</hi> ſaid All that God brought out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and that he at that preſent was with, ſhould enter into <hi>Canaan:</hi> but as he, ſo the Apoſtle believingly feeding upon the goodneſs of God, joyes in it, and is raiſed up to exceeding confidence by it; and ſhews that they who are in Chriſt and walk after the ſpirit (as they did) have no condemnation, but are kept from it by the Death, Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Interceſſion of Chriſt believed on by them; but he affirmes not that, of all that he dyed, roſe and intercedes for.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Whereas a little after he ſaith, That God only promiſed to Chriſt that he ſhould be Captain of all Salvation to all that believe, and effectually bring many ſons to glory;</q> he ſaith not truely: for he promiſed him alſo, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 2.8, 9. That he ſhould rule the Nations with an Iron rod, and break them in pieces as a potters veſſel, as he tels us he hath alſo received, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.26, 27. And therefore that Chriſt look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only and alone (as Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> alſo ſaith) for the accompliſhment of thoſe things that he there mentioned, is falſe alſo; He looked for, and doth and ſhall ſee the other made good to him too. But ſo much to his deviations in this Chapter. The fifth only ſhewing that the Holy Ghoſt hath his concurrence, and had his operation in the birth, death, and reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, and no Argument be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thence drawn to his purpoſe, I ſhall paſs it over and proceed to the following Chapters.</p>

                        <hi>A further view of what he affirmes of the equal latitude and extent of the Oblation and Interceſſion of Chriſt in his ſixth Chapter, and ſeventh.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>HIs ſixth Chapter goes over the ſame things again ſpoken of in the fourth, only here they are conſidered as means conducing to an end; namely the <hi>Incarnation, Oblation,</hi> and <hi>Interceſſion</hi> of Chriſt; the laſt of which <hi>[Interceſſion]</hi> he ſays contains every act of his exaltation, even his Reſurrection; for which he brings no proof at all, nor any reaſon wherewith to back it, only quotes <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. which ſaith no ſuch thing, but that he roſe again for our
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:117749:35"/>juſtification: no nor appears it (as he ſaith) that by his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all his following diſpenſation and perpetual interceſsion is there intended. Its but his conception without proof, it may rather he conceived that in ſaying, <hi>For our juſtification;</hi> he means that he might do all thoſe acts conducing to our juſtification, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude his Interceſſion there, then that in the word <hi>Reſurrection</hi> thoſe acts are intended. Nor ſaith <hi>Acts</hi> 3.26. any ſuch thing; and her falſifies it doubly in his quotation of it. For firſt, he renders it thus, that God raiſed up his Son Jeſus to bleſs us: Whereas the Text is, having raiſed him up he hath ſent him to bleſs. I conceive he means it of his ſending him in the Goſpel, which is a preaching of Chriſt and offering him to men. And then, to bleſs us; as if he ſpake of the believers, whereas he ſaith to bleſs you, in turning eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of you from your iniquities. Which place duly weighed, ſhews the vanity of his arguing from ſuch ſpeeches that mention the end of Chriſts ſending. For though there he is ſaid to be ſent to bleſs them in turning every one of them there ſpoken to, from their iniquities, by which he preſſes his exhortation to them for Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; yet it no where appeareth nor can he prove it, that all them people were ever ſo bleſſed and turned away from their iniquities; onely there Chriſt was held forth to them as authoriſed of God and ready to do it in their liſtening to him: the perception of which perhaps made him ſo cleverly to change the words <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:117749:35"/>of his Death, nor expreſsing any thing of his Interceſsion, much leſs ſaying that it hath the ſame extent to perſons and things as his Death, and that other place of <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.19. being but a begging the queſtion, and impertinent as hath been ſhewed, in that it extends but to thoſe that Chriſt ſays he ſent into the world) as alſo the main proofs of it being reſerved to the following Chapters, we ſhall procede to view them, only premiſing this; that,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Should we grant theſe things, they would not prejudice our Cauſe, as hath in part been ſhewed on chapter fourth: He might offer himſelf to ranſom men, and to provide for means of grace and patience to be extended to them, in attention to which they might meet with his power to Save them,
<note place="margin">Luk. 13.7, 8.</note> and Intercede for thoſe things too for them, and yet many abuſing the grace procured by both (as is ſuppoſed in the parable of the barren fig-tree) they might not be eternally ſaved. So that his after-concluſion in this Chapter would not thence follow, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>That every one for whom he died, muſt actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally have applyed to him all the good things purchaſed by his Death:</hi>
                     </q> except he can firſt prove, that whoever Chriſt Intercedes for, he In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercedes for all thoſe good things for them which he procured by his Death: Which I am confident he cannot prove. For to ſpeak in his own Dialect, He ſaith, <q>
                        <hi>that the Death of Chriſt purchaſed the Spirit, and the whole confluence of the grace of God.</hi>
                     </q> I would ask him then, if it purchaſed not Apoſtleſhip and the gift of prophecy, &amp;c. If no, then are ſome good things conferred upon ſome that were not purchaſed by his Death, contrary to his Aſſertion, <hi>pag.</hi> 33. <hi>line</hi> 5. If yea, then I demand, whether every one for whom he dyed have the gift of Apoſtleſhip and prophecy conferred upon them; if he ſay yes, then he contradicts the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. if no, then his Concluſion is proved falſe. If it be replied, that he means but of things eſſentially neceſſary to every one for eternall life, then yet</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We deſire his proof for this, That whoever Chriſt dyed for, or that he intercedes for, them he intercedes for eternall life, or makes ſuch interceſſion for them, as the Apoſtle tels us he makes for them that come unto God by him; which becauſe he promiſes (in effect) in the next Chapter, I now thither follow him to view his Arguments or Reaſons which are as followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>His firſt Argument is taken from a powerful <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion that the Scripture makes of both thoſe,
<note place="margin">On Chap. 7. Arg.</note> almoſt alwayes joyning them together, and ſo manifeſting thoſe things to be inſeparable
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:117749:36"/>which are looked upon as the diſtinct fruits and effects of them.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before I anſwer to his Arguments, I ſhall repeat again the main propoſition undertaken by him, which is this, that the Oblation and Interceſſion of Chriſt have not only the ſame perſons for their Object, but that they have alſo all the ſame good things for each perſon, and all and only the ſame. Which I oppoſe but as in the word <hi>Interceſſion</hi> he aimes at the prime exerciſe of it; for that he intercedes for the moſt ſpecial favors for perſons for whom he dyed, I deny not; but that he doth it for all thoſe for whom he dyed, that I deſire to have proved. His firſt Argument for which, put into a form runs thus.</p>
                  <p>What things the Scripture almoſt always couples together, they have the ſame adequate objects, and their diſtinct fruits and effects are inſeparable, and extend to all the ſame perſons joyntly; but the Scripture almoſt always couples Chriſts Oblation, and Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion together, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The major propoſition here is falſe, as may be ſeen in many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, as the bringing the Iſraelites out of <hi>Egypt</hi> and poſſeſſing them of <hi>Canaan,</hi> are very frequently joyned together, as often at leaſt as Chriſts Death and Interceſſion, and yet had not the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dequate object, though both means of performing Gods Covenant and promiſe to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed. See for the proof of this, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.37, 38. <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.8, &amp; 6.68. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.33, &amp; 26.7, 8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.43, 44. <hi>cum multis aliis.</hi> Again the Scripture frequently mentions, Chriſts preaching to the people and healing their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes together, as <hi>Math.</hi> 4, 27. &amp; 9.35. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.36, 38. <hi>Luk.</hi> 5.15. &amp; 6.17. and both tended to glorifie his Father and make known his name. But I ſuppoſe that none will ſay therefore that both had the ſame adequate object, and that he preached to no more then were healed by him. The like I might ſay for teaching or preaching and baptiſing, both ordained to the ſame ſaving end, and often mentioned together, and yet not both of equal latitude: the latter not done to All, for and to whom the other was vouchſafed.</p>
                  <p>So that that Propoſition hath no truth and it, and therefore the Argument is invalid. Nor doth he prove the Minor, that Oblation and Interceſsion are <hi>almoſt always</hi> joyned together in the Scriptures. He hath ſcarce any pertinent proofs that they are ſo ioyned at all,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:117749:36"/>not above one or two at moſt. He alledges firſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11. <q>
                        <hi>By his knowledg ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many, for he ſhall bear their iniquities.</hi>
                     </q> Which proves, that many whoſe ſins he bare, ſhall by his knowledg be juſtified, and that thoſe many that by his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg he ſhall juſtifie, had their ſins born by him, and he having born their ſins could and ſhould by his knowledge juſtifie them; but that neither ſaith he ſhould juſtifie all whoſe ſins he bare, nor ſhould make Interceſsion to that purpoſe; nor makes any mention of his Interceſsion. <q>And whereas he ſayes they are ſo put together in the next verſe,</q> that ſurely none ought to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them. Let us conſider how they are put together. The words are, <hi>He hath born the ſins of many, and ſhall make interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the tranſgreſſors.</hi> Which proves, that both Oblation and Interceſsion are the Works of Chriſt; which we deny not, nor is that the thing to be proved, but that his Interceſsion is for all the ſame perſons for whom he died, and that too for all the good things that his Death procured, that place ſayes not: There are different words uſed to expreſs the objects; He ſhall bear the ſins of <hi>multitudes</hi> or <hi>manies,</hi> there is his oblation, but now he adds not, and he ſhall make Interceſsion for all them, no nor ſaith he for them, but (uſing another word) He ſhall intercede for Tranſgreſſors; how many or who they be, or whether he intercede for all good things procured by his Death for any or not, that ſaith nothing. It mentions Oblation and Interceſsion both, its true, but that's but once yet, and the Argument concludes not from it, as is before ſhewed. He quotes alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. which mentions not his Interceſsion, but his Reſurrection for our Juſtification, ſo that thats impertinent as to the Minor.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34. Mentions both, its true, but that is ſpoken to in <hi>chap.</hi> 4. and the vanity of his collection from there ſhewed. His inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <q>That <hi>He died onely for the Elect, and that none ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for whom Chriſt died, and that there is proved there an equal extent of his Oblation and Interceſſion,</hi>
                     </q> are not the Apoſtles but his own, as we before noted on <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. The firſt of them being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary alſo to 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5 6. and 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. The ſecond of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to thoſe ſuppoſitions of the Apoſtle in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3. and that affirmation in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. For the third, Its there aſſerted that the Elect and Believers in Chriſt have his Death, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and Interceſſion, all for them, and that they are in a ſafe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:117749:37"/>condition thereby, but ſaith not that all he died for had them all; as hath been noted. For his giving all things with Chriſt, we ſhall finde it elſewhere, where we alſo ſhall anſwer it. Now theſe two places, of <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.12. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34. being the onely two places wherein Oblation and Interceſſion are coupled together, and they ſcarce the tithe of the places where his Death is mentioned; his <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> is alſo falſe, and ſo the whole Argument ineffectual. And the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is like it, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg. </seg>2</label> Becauſe they are <hi>Acts of the ſame Office of Prieſthood.</hi> The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from thence runs thus.</p>
                  <p>The Acts that pertain eſſentially to the ſame Office, muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed upon, or for all the ſame perſons, and the one for All things for which the other. But Oblation and Interceſſion are acts of the ſame Office. <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Major</hi> of this too is denied: and proved falſe, thus. To Preach and to Baptize were both acts of the Office of the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and of the Miniſters of the Goſpel ſent by Chriſt into the world, <hi>Matt.</hi> 28.19. and yet it follows not that whoever they preached to, them alſo they baptized: nor can it be proved that the Prieſts uſed to pray for whomſoever they offered up a Sacrifice for. That of 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2, 1, 2. we have before ſcanned, That he is appointed to intercede for All that come to God by him, and ſo an high Prieſt for that purpoſe over Gods Houſe, he proves well out of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> but that all that Chriſt died for, do go to God by Chriſt, or that he is appointed to make interceſſion for all that he died for, that he proves not, nor doth any Text in that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle or elſewhere ſpeak it.</p>
                  <p>His concluſion then, "<hi>That if he perform either of the acts of his Prieſthood for any, he muſt of neceſsity alſo perform the other for them,</hi> flowes neither from the ſtrength of his premiſes in his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor from any of his proofs, but is the iſſue fo his own miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided reaſon. His <hi>abſurd,</hi> that elſe we make him but an half Prieſt or unfaithful, is an abſurdity it ſelf: For was not <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> a full Miniſter of the Goſpel, and ſo the twelve Apoſtles, or ſhall they be taxed with unfaithfulneſs in their Office if they baptized not all that they preached to, becauſe Baptizing and Preaching were both injoyned them in their Commiſſion, and pertained to them as Chriſts Miniſters? but no more to that.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg. </seg>3</label> 
                     <q>His third Argument is taken from the <hi>Nature of his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion, which,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>is only a preſentation of himſelf, ſprinkled</hi>
                        <pb n="35" facs="tcp:117749:37"/>with the blood of the Covenant, before the throne of grace in our behalf, an appearing in the preſence of God for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24. and ſo is nothing elſe but an Oblation continued in poſtulating thoſe things which by it were procured. Thence he argues, How can he be ſaid to offer for them for whom he doth not intercede, when his Interceſſion is nothing elſe but a preſenting his Oblation in behalf of them for whom he ſuffered, and for the beſtowing the the good things thereby purchaſed?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer, that firſt, This ſeemeth to ſwallow up his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion into his Oblation, and ſo to confound thoſe things that he before diſtinguiſhed, having no Scripture to back it that his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion is but a continuance of his Oblation; nay rather the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture goes againſt it; for it ſpeaks of his offering as a thing done and perfected, not continually doing, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.13. This man after he had offered one ſacrifice for ſins for ever, ſat down at the right hand of God: he firſt offered that before he ſate down. And were it not ſo, the difference between him and the Prieſts of the Law ſhould not be ſo cleer. The Apoſtle oppoſes his offering and ſitting down, to their ſtanding daily to miniſter and offering oftentimes the ſame ſacrifice. Now if his interceſſion be a preſenting or a continuation of his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, then he ſhould ſtand to miniſter and offer daily too, for his interceſſion is a work in doing and continually to be done, He ever lives to be make Interceſſion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. Again, though its true, He appears (or is manifeſted) in the preſence of God for us, yet whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that appearing there onely to preſent his oblation for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing the good things thereby purchaſed, be all the matter of his interceſſion, or all the matter there aimed at, is doubtful; as alſo whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſo appear for all he dyed for, as is there expreſſed. For I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he ſo appeared as Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> mentions, in his firſt enterance thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſo ſoon as he entred &amp; offered he appeared, and his continuance in his Fathers ſight is contained in his ſitting down or being at the Fathers right hand; but the Interceding is ſpoken of as a thing beyond that <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34. He is at the right hand of God and alſo maketh interceſsion for us; that <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>[and alſo] puts the buſineſs of his interceſſion a little further, every ſingle expreſsion of ſome act of Chriſt in heaven may not hold forth all his buſineſs there, as every ſingle expreſsion of his returning acts holds not forth all he ſhall do at his return as in, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.29. He ſhall appear without ſin to ſalvation, doth not argue that his very appearing without any
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:117749:38"/>other act ſhall eſtate the Saints into the full poſſeſſion of ſalvation: ſure he ſhall raiſe them and do other acts alſo. Surely his Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath in it alſo a preſentation of his will to the Father concerning ſuch or ſuch particulars as indeed are founded upon his offering; or he hath liberty and priviledge thereby to will or ask (for the word <gap reason="foreign">

But ſuppoſe that thats alſo includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that phraſe of the Apoſtle, and that Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> means as much in ſaying he poſtulates thoſe things which by his oblation were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured; yet then that he doth appear to will or ask all thoſe good things to be diſpenſed to All for whom he dyed, which his Death for any procured (as his phraſe with the whole tenor of his arguing intimates that he means) or that Interceſſion and Advocation ſpoke of in <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. &amp; 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.2.

                     <q>His fourth argument is from the identity of the end; that if the Death of Chriſt procured and obtained that every good thing ſhould be beſtowed which is actually conferred by the intervening of his Interceſſion, then they have both of them the ſame end and aim: his Minor ſhould be, that the Death of Chriſt procured and obtained that every good thing ſhould be beſtowed which is actually conferred by his Interceſsion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> which he neither proveth, nor (did he) doth it conclude the <hi>Concludendum,</hi> that is the ſame Object in all the things his Death procured. So that his after infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>viz,</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. The way of God in rewarding his Son, is in giving him All things into his hands, glorifying him, and thereby drawing ſouls to him to ſtay upon him, and then granting him all his deſires in them of all the fulneſs of his glory as he ſees good to meaſure out amongſt them; Not that he would make them all glorious that he dyed for, but only all of them that in the day of grace are brought into him to believe on him: So that neither will this Argument ſerve him up to his intention.</p>

<label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Argu. </seg>6</label> That the ſeperating and dividing the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:117749:39"/>Death and Interceſsion of Chriſt in regard of the objects, cuts off all that conſolation which any ſoul might hope to attain by an Aſſurance that Chriſt dyed for him.</q> But thats falſe; for this doctrine of Chriſts dying for All men, though joyned with this, that he makes Interceſsion but for All that come to God by him, gives both ground and incouragement for every man upon hearſay of it, to look to God and go to him by Chriſt, as one that hath teſtified ſuch great love to him as to open ſuch a way of acceſſe for him through the blood of his Son; and alſo aſſures him of ſtrong conſolation upon his going to him, and thats the Apoſtles phraſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18. we might have ſtrong conſolation that have fled for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge to lay hold on the hope ſet before us. So that here's never a whit the leſs cenſolation for them that do believe then in their way; and there is more ground and incouragement for any man to believe, then in their way; this doctrine ſhewing more evidently teſtimonies of Gods love to any man then the other doth; That can aſſure none of Chriſts Interceſſion but upon believing, this doctrine aſſures ſuch as believe of it too. So that that Affirmation that the <q>Doctrine of the General Ranſom cuts in pieces all the nerves and ſinews of that ſtrong conſolation that God is ſo abundantly willing we ſhould receive,</q> is a very groſs miſtake, as I hope by this is evident and may afterward more appear. Mean while I would have Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> minde, that his doctrine leaves men at an uncertain whether there be any mediator for them or no till they can finde fruits of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection in them; which how any ſhould do till he firſt know love in God towards him &amp; the mediation of Chriſt for him, ſo as that by the knowledg thereof he be brought to truſt in God by him, I would faine have any man to prove. Yea that doctrine layes open men horribly to deſperate courſes, while the very proper reſult of it is, that All men are under one of theſe two decrees, either Elect or Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, either he hath a mediator or not: ſo that any man may ſay, Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt dyed for me or not, <q>If he did, I am ſure enough what ever ſin I commit Chriſt will follow me into every Court,</q> &amp; I ſhall be ſafe enough in the iſſue; yea I am already ſafe enough by his Death and Interceſſion though I know it not; therefore why ſhould I take care for any thing? If God will have me know it, he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal it to me, bring me to the means, or the means to me, and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not periſh, the proper fountain of that <hi>Ergo agite juvenes</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> in his preface. If not, I ſhall periſh let me do
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:117749:39"/>what I can; and I had as good ſave the labor of afflicting my ſelf in hearing and praying, &amp;c. as to tire my ſelf out about needleſs buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, to get that, which if I be excluded the Death of Chriſt, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be obtained, and which ſhall be thruſt upon me and I cannot miſs what courſe ſoever I take if I be not. See, ſir, if theſe do not inevitably flow from your principles. As for our doctrine it lies not open to theſe looſe conſequences, for if I know and believe that Chriſt dyed for me, I know and believe alſo that he is ready and able to ſave me, and looking to him and going to God by him he will aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly ſave, being found in him and yeelding up to his ſpirit, this doctrine tels me that not any ſin acted through infirmity and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſhall appear againſt me to condemne me; His Death, Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and Interceſſion ſhall have their fruit in me to eternal life; but if I neglect ſo great ſalvation, or deny him that bought me, turn away from him that ſpeaks from heaven and hath the blood of ſprinkling to ſprinkle upon me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then how ſhall I eſcape? then how ſhall not his love riſe up into jealouſie and the greater condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation fall upon me? and are not theſe agreeable to the Apoſtles reaſonings in his Doctrine? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1.13.33, 34. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3, &amp; 10.25, 26, 29. &amp; 12.24, 25. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1.

                     </label> The Ranſome and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Chriſt is no larger then his offices of Prieſt, Prophet and King; But theſe offices pertain to his Church and choſen: Therefore his Ranſom pertaines to them only. I confeſs they that propounded the Objection ſo (as I believe the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:117749:40"/>had it ſo delivered to him in writing) propounded it fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly, the concluſion containing <hi>a quartus terminus,</hi> and having more in it then follows from the premiſes. Indeed I have heard it thus propounded. The Offices of Chriſt are of equal extent: But his Kingly and prophetical Offices pertain but to his Church: <hi>Ergo,</hi> his Prieſtly pertains to them onely. The <hi>Minor</hi> of which I deny, and would invert it thus. His Offices are of equal extent in regard of their Object, But his Kingly and Prophetical Offices extend to All; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo his Prieſtly. The <hi>Minor</hi> I prove thus. He is King of all the earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 47.7. which ſpeaks of God aſcended who is the ſame that firſt deſcended, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks upon a like Scripture. So he is King upon the holy hill of Sion, and all Nations given him, and the utmoſt parts of the earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.7, 8. King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, and therefore ſure of all under them, Kings and Lords too. And ſo he is a Prophet for them that hear him, and them that refuſe to hear him too, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.22, 23. and indeed if he was not a Prophet ſent of God to any but the Elect, then none but they ſhould be in danger for not hearing him; for God uſeth not to puniſh men for not attending to Ordinances that were not for them; or not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Prophet that prophecieth nothing to them; ſo that there he is clearly held forth to be a Prophet to more then his Church and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen. Yea as it pertains to his Prophetical Office to reveal the Truth of God, ſo (as the Wiſdom of God) he cries in the ſtreets to the ſons of men, and to thoſe that are without, <hi>Pro.</hi> 1.20. and is the light that lightneth every man that cometh into the world. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo far alſo his mediation muſt extend, for its the life in him is the light of men, even that life that he hath for men. <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5, 6.</p>
                  <p>But let us ſee what he ſaith to the Anſwerer of the Objection. Firſt, He in ſtead of removing dung, caſts dung upon him, as if he was <q>guilty of making a diſtinction or diviſion between the death of Chriſt and the ranſom,</q> as if he might die for All, and not be the ranſom of All. Whereas indeed the Anſwer intimated that to be the Objectors conception. Its clear that he is every where in his Book contrary to it, making the death of Chriſt as for All, to be "the ranſom. And whereas he thinks there is no man in his right wit will propoſe it; I know not what wit they are in, but I believe men that have as good conceits of their wit, as Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> hath, have hinted, if not expreſſed ſuch a diſtinction: I can ſhew him one (by name, Mr. <hi>How,</hi> who lately put out an Anſwer to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:117749:40"/>the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſaliſt,</hi> as he ſtiles him) who in a writing to my ſelf, grants that all men had intereſt in the Act of Chriſts Death, as buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or purchaſing men into his diſpoſe, and yet ſtifly denies him to be the ranſom for all. Well,

                     </label> but what was the Anſwer to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection? It was this. <q>The mediation of Chriſt is more general, or more ſpecial. More general as he mediates between God and men,</q> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. More ſpecial as Mediator of the New Teſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. Which Anſwer, firſt, he <hi>Turkaſes,</hi> as if he had ſaid,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Repl. </seg>
                     </label> a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Mediator and a ſpecial, and then digreſſes into a little Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical paſſion againſt the barbarouſneſs of the expreſſion; whenas indeed the ſenſe is plain enough, and the proofs pat to the purpoſe. For though he be but one Mediator, and the Office one intire Office in it ſelf; yet in regard of his mediation or exerciſe of that Office, he may exerciſe it in ſome way, and for ſome things for more, then in ſome other way, and for ſome other things. Even as God is but one, and his Government one in him, yet in regard of the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of it, it in ſome things and way comprehends more then in ſome others; and ſo his ſaving acts in ſome expreſſions and exerciſes are towards more then in others, as in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. is plain. Now to me this is plain, that the mediation of Chriſt as ſpoken of in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. is of other and larger extent in reſpect of reference to its Object, then as its ſpoken of in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. In the former place its ſpoken of as a demonſtration of Gods good will to, and in ſome ſenſe a ground for our praying for All men, not for the Church and choſen onely, but for All men, for Kings and all in authority, which never any man yet affirmed to be all members of Chriſt, and heirs of life. Now, that that demonſtrates Gods good will to all men, and is a ground of our Mediating, or Interceding for All (<hi>ver.</hi> 1.) muſt it ſelf be ſomething extending to All, or elſe the building ſhould be greater then may be ſupported by its foundation. So that there ſurely he is ſpoken of as a Mediator, ſo appointed of God, and ſo acting as a Mediator, that thereupon All, or (as <hi>Beza</hi> renders it) any one may be the Object of our prayers, and hath incouragement to ſeek to God to be ſaved by him, and ſo as a general Mediator, or a Mediator that is ſet up for All men, and hath accordingly given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a ranſome for All men. But in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. his Mediation is ſpoken of as exerciſed about a peculiar Object, in a more ſpecial maner, for ſpecal things, the performance of the Legacies given to Sion, for the called of God, that they might receive that to which they are
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:117749:41"/>called, and of which they are made heirs, even the eternal inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. As a Prince may mediate between his Father offended and rebellious ſubjects in general for many things: and in a ſpecial maner for thoſe that lay down Arms and come over to him; he may demand or urge his Father to ſhew more favor to them then to all the reſt, and yet ask favor for them too. But this is admired that Chriſt ſhould be Mediator and not of a New Teſtament. Whereas we affirm him Mediator of the New Teſtament, and deny it not But that he mediates that for All, or that his mediation for men as ſpoken of in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5 6. is, that the New Teſtament, might be performed to them all whoſe Mediator he is, will require ſome time for him to prove. <q>He ſaies a Mediator is not of one (which we grant) and all mediation reſpects an agreement of ſeveral parties, and every Mediator is the Mediator of a Covenant.</q> All which may be granted with reference to Chriſt; if by Covenant we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Covenant made between God and Chriſt; but as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe its not always true (<hi>Joab</hi> may mediate for <hi>Abſolom,</hi> and yet no Covenant made between <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Abſolom;</hi> and the Vine-Dreſſer for the barren Fig-tree, and yet not mediate any Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made with the Fig-tree, nor for any Legacies fore-given to the Fig-tree) ſo neither follows it thence, that Chriſt mediates the New Teſtament for all he mediates for. The word there in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, ſignifies a Teſtament or Will, made and confirmed by Death, as <hi>ver.</hi> 16. ſhews; and the New Teſtament is the promiſes of God, bequeathed to the believer, the called, the choſen. Now though Chriſt mediates not the giving theſe to them that are uncall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet he may notwithſtanding mediate for Gods forbearance, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, diſpenſation of means, ſuch as in which they may be invited, and have opportunities to look to him for mercy to be afforded. I think not the Aſſertor, ſo much as the Oppoſer of that paſſage needs further Conſideration, I will not ſay Catechiſing, in this buſineſs, and I am perſwaded the Aſſertor is pretty able to anſwer for himſelf, were Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> his Catechiſer. Nay, were Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> asked this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, how he can prove that Jeſus Chriſt mediates nothing but the New Teſtament, nor for any but thoſe that are made heirs of it, it would put him to it to finde proofs for it. I am confident he could produce no better proofes then what he doth produce here to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this general extent of his mediation, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                     <q>That it was his Church that he redeemed, loved, and gave himſelf for, his ſheep
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:117749:41"/>he laid down his life for, appears in heaven for us. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> And what then? who denies that? or how doth that diſprove the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? It was <hi>Iſrael</hi> that God created, <hi>Ergo</hi> none elſe? they that have the Spirit of Chriſt in them ſhall be raiſed, <hi>Ergo</hi> none elſe? God will raiſe us up by his power, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14. <hi>Ergo</hi> none elſe or not all? Again he ſayes, <q>Becauſe the children partooke of fleſh and blood, therefore he alſo took part with them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14.</q> Therefore he took part with none elſe in them; or mediated for none but them. Like this, Becauſe many undertook to write the Goſpel of Chriſt, therefore <hi>Luke</hi> wrote alſo, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.1. therefore he wrote for no mans cauſe but theirs, as if the word <hi>Becauſe</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways intimates or refers to the whole cauſe or reaſon of a thing. <q>So, for their ſakes (<hi>viz.</hi> whom I have ſent into the world as thou haſt ſent me) I ſanctifie my ſelf, <hi>John</hi> 17.18, 19.</q> 
                     <hi>Ergo</hi> I mediate for none but them. But then, I pray, to what purpoſe ſent he them into the world, if none in and of the world to which they were ſent had and Oblation offered up for them? <q>So he roſe for our Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</q> but how far that <hi>us</hi> extends, he tells us not, whether it reach to all the Object of his Death and Reſurrection, and if ſo, whether that be not as large an <hi>us</hi> as that in <hi>Act.</hi> 17.27. not far from any one of <hi>us,</hi> for in him we live; or as that <hi>[our]</hi> in thoſe expreſsions <hi>Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.

                     </q> But in this he miſtakes: we reaſon it not meerly from that as barely ſo expreſſed; but from that as laid down for a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of Gods good will to All; his willing all men to be
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:117749:42"/>ſaved, and as the foundation of our praying for All; and from that (that the Apoſtle addes) he gave himſelf a Ranſom for All, which I conceive to be an act of mediation. Our reaſoning then runs thus, That which argues the good will of God to All, pertains to All: But Chriſts being a Mediator between God and men is an argument of his love and good will to All: Therefore it pertains to all. The major leans upon this propoſition, That which holds forth love but to ſome, cannot be an Argument of love to All; That that argues love to All muſt concern all. The minor is the coherence of the fourth and fifth verſes. Again thus, That which Chriſt hath acted in for All, pertains to All, but Chriſt hath acted in his media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for All, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This ariſes from the fifth coupled with the ſixth verſe. Again thus, If the mediation of Chriſt be a good foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for our praying for All or any men, then it ſelf muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern All: But ſo it is, as its laid down by the Apoſtle in that place, compared with <hi>verſ.</hi> 1, 2, 3. Our prayers are groundleſs for any that he is not appointed as mediator for, therefore to incourage us to pray for all, he ſhews us a mediator that hath acted for All.</p>
                  <p>"His conceit on 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. we have ſeen and ſpoken to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. and ſhewed it to be a vain conceit, that God as the object of the Apoſtles truſt, in all his labor and ſufferings ſhould be conſidered but as a Saviour out of Chriſt: for the word Saviour is but once uſed there, and if it ſignifie at all a Saviour without Chriſts mediation, then it doth ſo to both branches, beſides that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he nor any of them can prove God a Saviour to ſinners (as all men are) without the interpoſition of a mediator. I would ask how he deals with men in that ſaving them? whether according to the Covenant of works which curſeth according to deſerts? If ſo, then no room for ſaving them from the death deſerved by them, no not for a moment. If not, then I ask according to what he ſaves? and what it is that procures that he deals not with them in that ſevere way of their deſerts? The caſe of beaſts inſtanced in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36. ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of a twofold exception.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That they have not ſinned, nor is there a law impoſed upon them, the tranſgreſſion of which needs a mediator for their ſaving, as the caſe of man is.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That as they partook of vanity for mans ſins ſake, ſo why may not their preſervation for and to men be looked upon as a mercy
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:117749:42"/>ſafed to man by vertue of Chriſts mediation for the ſin of man, which laid them open to deſtruction for the puniſhment of man: "as far wide is his inſtancing 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9, 10. the Apoſtles truſting in God that raiſes the dead; as if he would tels that God as he acts in raiſing the dead, acts not through Chriſts mediation, or through Jeſus Chriſt; and ſo thats falſe, that <hi>As by man came Death, ſo alſo by man came the reſurrection of the Dead;</hi> for he intimates that he raiſes the Dead, without eyeing the interpoſition or media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man, the man Chriſt. As vain is that, that the place fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoted ſpeakes of God the Father; as if Chriſt was excluded from being the object of the Apoſtles faith for preſervation, and as if God the Father wrought without Chriſt, contrary to <hi>John</hi> 5.20. and were a Saviour to ſinners in any way out of Chriſt, and not through him; all which are poſtulata's no way proveable. For his wonder, that Chriſt ſhould be a Saviour of them that are not ſaved, its no greater then that God ſhould purge ſome that yet were not purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and yet the Scripture plainly affirms that, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.13. or made a Feaſt for them that never eat of it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.4. <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.24. to ſay nothing that in ſome acts of ſaving they are ſaved, and might in more, did they not by obſerving lying vanities forſake their own mercies. But we ſhall ſay more to this in <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>Lib.</hi> 2, where it is further urged. O but he never gives grace to ſome to believe. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he gives to All more then they improve or well like of, and would give them more did they not ſmother what he gives them, and thats all I ſhall ſay to it here, for we ſhall meet with it in fitter place, as alſo with that other abſurdity (as he thinks) that he ſhould be a Saviour to them that never hear one word of ſaving. If they have the thing in any ſenſe, its not material that they never hear of its name. God did gird <hi>Cyrus</hi> though <hi>Cyrus</hi> knew him not, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.5. and many may have real good by that whoſe right name they never heard of. I hope Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> is ſo charitable, that if one of his child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren ſhould dy in infancy, he would think it might be ſaved by Chriſt, though it never heard or underſtood a ſyllable of Chriſt or of a Saviour. He things it abſurd too, that Chriſt ſhould be a Saviour in a twofold ſenſe, <hi>for all, and for believers.</hi> But I hope he doth what the Father doth, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 5.19. but the Father is the Saviour of All and eſpecially of believers, as himſelf grants, and Chriſt ſaith he came to ſave the lives of men,
<note place="margin">Luk 9.56.</note> whether he do no more to believers then is there ſpoken of I leave to his conſideration; He is the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:117749:43"/>of the World, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.14. and the Saviour of his body the Church, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.25, 26. whether the world be his Church and body, I leave to him alſo to ſhew. Whether the condition of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving be procured by him for All or for any, I leave to its place, and in the mean time deſire him to prove by Scripture his perſwaſion, <q>that to whom Chriſt is in any ſenſe a Saviour in the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, them he ſaves to the uttermoſt from all their ſins of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity and diſobedience, with the ſaving of grace here and glory hereafter;</q> and in particular that he ſo ſaved thoſe, to whom in the knowledg of himſelf as a Saviour he gave an eſcape from the pollutions in the world who afterward backſlid from him, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20, 21.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Whereas anſwer was further made to his Objection,

                        </note> that he in ſome ſort intercedes for tranſgreſſors, the ſons of men yet in and of the world, that they through Gods bleſſings on their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration may be convinced and be brought to acknowledg that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus is the Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> but more eſpecially for the called, believers &amp;c. Here Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> firſt miſtakes his Anſwer,

                        <hi>M. O.</hi>
                     </note> as if he had ſaid he prayed for them that they might be brought to faith in God through Chriſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually ſaving to life eternal; and then oppoſes him in that concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Whereas he only ſaid to believe the report of the Goſpel (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that in <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.21, 23.) and to come to ſome perceptions of light therein, whereto attending they might be brought fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or which refuſing they may be hardned for it. Then he askes,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. "In what ſort Chriſt intercedes for that for ſuch, <hi>John</hi> 17? I anſwer for him: in that ſort as Chriſt expreſſes himſelf in <hi>John</hi> 17.21, 23. obliquely, as we pray for the good of a Kingdom when we pray for a ſpirit of wiſdom, and government, on Kings and men in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. Its true believers are the direct Object of his interceſſion for thoſe things conducing to this convincement and to this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and faith, even as Kings and Magiſtrates are in thoſe prayers inſtanced, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2. though in other inſtances they may be the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect object as the Fig-tree of that Interceſſion, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.7. and the perſecutors of that in <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.34. But then he askes whether it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be accompliſhed. I ſuppoſe it is and ſhall be in due time according to the tenor of our Saviours praying for it; but to me he ſeemes to wrangle with our Saviour himſelf about his expreſſions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he gives no fuller account of his petitions. Its likely he would
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:117749:43"/>the ſame query about our Saviours praying for believers unity, and ſay, Did Chriſt abſolutely intend it or no? and if ſo, then why is it not better effected but that there are ſo many diviſions even amongſt them? Chriſts prayers have I conceive in part their Anſwer here, but not fully till the perfect day, when all the world ſhall ſee and ſay, <hi>This is Sion, the City of the Lord,</hi> and this is the truth of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. "He demands if it be by vertue of his blood ſhed for them? I anſwer, I conceive it is: had he not offered up himſelf a ranſom, and removed their death and condemnation, he had had no ground to ask any further favor for them; had he not come with blood for ſin that cryed for vengeance, no hearing I conceive of any ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for them. But then he ſaith, it follows that by his death he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured faith for all. But thats a miſtake. For firſt, Neither is this aſſerted for All, though for others then the Elect only. Nor ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Follows it that his death (if he mean ſimply and <hi>per ſe</hi>) procured it, nay rather the contrary, for then what need of any further Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, or petition for it? <hi>fruſtra fit per plura,</hi> &amp;c. A man may with boldneſs go to requeſt a new lone of another for a man that plaid the bankrupt &amp; had run far into his debt, bringing pay with him for the former debt, that perhaps might have had no admittance for his ſuit in that kinde without that payment made, and yet that pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment meerly procured not the ſecond lone. That may be <hi>cauſa partialis &amp; ſine quâ non</hi> of a thing, that is not <hi>cauſa propriè &amp; plenè effectiva</hi> of it, Its not the payment of the old debt that either ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges him that pays to borrow anew, or him that lends to lend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new, but grace in both, from the
<note n="*" place="margin">Orgiver.</note> lender to the borrower, and from both to him for whom he borrows it. Chriſt hath ſuch grace in his Fathers eyes, that he having paid our old ſcore may ask a new ſtock and obtain it, though his meer payment without that asking did not oblige the Father to it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <q>He askes if he interceded for them with an intention and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that they ſhould believe or not.</q> I anſwer, Yes ſure, for I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe elſe he would not ſo have prayed; and ſo they do and ſhall, though not ſo far as his queſtion here ſuppoſes. That which he deſires to be granted conducing to that end, ſhalbe granted, but the end that he would have men attain to by thoſe means afforded, may by them not be ſo far obtained as he deſires them to preſs to. He would have them being convinced of the truth, cleave to it, follow after it,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:117749:44"/>acknowledg it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but many do not grant him his deſires, even as he would have gathered <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> children, and yet they would not; and as he rather pleaſes that men would turn and live, and yet many do not, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.27. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11. Yet that that he asks of his Father to that purpoſe as conducing to that end, <hi>viz.</hi> a bleſſing with his means afforded ſo far as that they have light drawn to them to attend on that they have, and ſhall acknowledg when their mouths ſhall be ſtopt for abuſing it. And in this is anſwered his two following Queries: As firſt, Whether it be for all and every man in the world? That neither was affirmed, nor in that place (<hi>Joh.</hi> 17.21.) held forth; but men of the world, others then the Church. Secondly, Whether abſolutely or conditionally? ſo that; abſolutely, that his Diſciples might be made fit means for ſuch an end: but for the worlds further believing and making good uſe of what they have, thats left to them upon the means, and thoſe convincements whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to chuſe the good, and refuſe the evil, or perſiſt in evil, and not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>huſe the good, and yet not without divers exhortations, motions, end counſels, to chuſe that thats good; and therefore for not chuſing ahe fear of the Lord they are after charged, <hi>Pro.</hi> 1.29. Whereas he t' demands Whether Chriſt prayes that they may uſe well the means 'of grace or not? I Anſwer, I finde no ſuch prayer, and yet it follows not, but that he prayed that they may believe thoſe things there mentioned, or rather that the Believers may walk ſo well as that the world (did they not wilfully ſhut their eyes) might ſee and believe thoſe truths, <hi>viz.</hi> both that that Doctrine concerning Chriſt is the truth, and that they are Gods people, God in them of a truth, which alſo will they nill they, they ſhall at length ſee and confeſs: and theſe acts of believing are not (as he ſaith) the uſing well the means of grace, but rather the effects of the means of grace well uſed by others, and the preventing operations of God, putting men into a fit capacity of obeying thoſe means. For when men are ſo far convinced, then muſt they either yeeld to follow God in the way they are convinced of (which indeed Chriſt by his ſervants prayes them to do, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. no where prayes his Father to make them do that I know of) or elſe wilfully and inexcuſably turn their backs of thoſe means to their own after-miſery. So that all this reaſoning hath not ſhaken the truth of the Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>He comes then to conſider the other proofs, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.12. he made interceſſion for tranſgreſſors, which he ſaies, are either all
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:117749:44"/>he ſuffered for, or thoſe he ſuffered by.</q> It may be both, and yet he gains nothing, thoſe by whom he ſuffered being alſo perſons for whom he ſuffered, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.3, 4. We eſteemed him not, we hid our faces from him, and yet he bare our ſins, thence alſo he prayes, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.34. <hi>Father forgive them.</hi> From which Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> (nextly conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it) firſt lays down a wrong inference as the Anſwerers, <hi>viz.</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is a general interceſſion for All that they might believe; which is far beyond what he affirmed; his words being but theſe, for tranſgreſſors, the ſons of men, yet in and of the world—and that thoſe amongſt whom believers converſe and dwell, might be convinced and brought in to believe the report, as <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.34. <hi>M. Moore</hi> ſaid not, that there he prayed for all in and of the world, but for them there perſecuting him, thence his after reaſonings againſt him fall to the ground; the extent of his mediation by way of Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for All, we rather conceive proveable from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5, 6. fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoken to, and from the actual diſpenſation of goodneſs and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to all, then from thoſe other places: onely we produce thoſe places againſt that poſition, that he intercedes in no wiſe for any but his Church and choſen ones, ſuch as are deſcribed, <hi>John.</hi> 17.6.9, 10, 20. Whereas he ſayes, <q>It appears not that he prayed for them all, but them that did it out of ignorance, nor for all that they ſhould believe, not for the chief Prieſts, they were not there, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer firſt, That they none of them knew what they did, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.17. with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7. no not the Rulers, and whereas he ſayes, <q>Its certain ſome did it ignorantly, but not all; thats his own, the Apoſtles except none,</q> yea he ſays, Had they known, they would have crucified the Lord of glory. Its true they knew more then they walked after, knew ſo much as might have perſwaded them other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in reaſon; but yet they knew not <hi>what they did,</hi> they knew not what and how glorious a <hi>one</hi> they put to death. Beſides our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſaith not, Father forgive thoſe of them that do it ignorantly or know not what they do, as if he prayed but for ſome of them; or as if ſome of them knew what they did, and others not, but indefinitely, <hi>Father forgive them, they know not what they do,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſay he interceded for them, we ſay not he interceeded there for them or All men that they ſhould believe, but that God forgiving them that their act of crucifying him, might yet ſpare them and continue with them yet the means of believing.</p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:117749:45"/>
                  <p n="3">3. Whether the chief Prieſts were there or no, its not material. He ſays not Father forgive them that are here, and therefore that yet wants proof, that he prayed only for thoſe crucifiers that were there, he prayed for them that crucified him uſing this argument, They know not what they do; and even thoſe there preſent were not his Church, believers, comers to God by him, given him out of the world, ſuch as had received his name, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as thoſe in <hi>John</hi> 17.</p>
                  <p>Whereas he ſays, <q>It cannot be ſuppoſed that Chriſt ſhould pray for all and every one of them ſuppoſing them to be finally impenitent, ſeeing he knew what was in man, and its contrary to to the rule we have, to pray for them whom we know to be final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impenitent.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, firſt, That Chriſt doth not uſe to condemn or withhold his goodneſs from a man before he be actually guilty of final im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency upon foreſight that he will be ſo: as God did not deny <hi>Adam</hi> communion with himſelf becauſe he foreſaw he would ſin, till he had actually ſinned: ſo Chriſt doth not withhold his offices of love from men becauſe he ſees they will abuſe them, for he knows how to glorifie himſelf and Father from his acts of love to them, though abuſed by them, he doth that that he ſees may be for their welfare, though he knows beforehand that they will turn it into a trap. He did not actually deny them the vertue of his death, till they actually upon tenders of it did obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and perſiſtingly reject and ſlieght it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.24. otherwiſe there ſhould be no difference between the time when he is riſen up and hath ſhut to the doors, and the time of his keeping open houſe and exerciſe of his patience and bounty towards them. Nay if he did not procure for them and afford unto them ſuch grace, they could not be guilty of abuſing it and turning it into wantonneſs, nor God ſo clearly and brightly glorious in his juſt condemning them. If he ſay that by finally impenitent he means, them that then had perſiſted in impenitency to the end even till the door of grace was ſhut upon them, then it remains for him to prove, that any of them as then were in that condition: ſurely this very prayer argues it was not then ſo ſhut againſt them. If he can prove it of any of them (his crucifiers) them we might indeed exclude from the patience and forgiveneſs here prayed for, and yet even ſo he gets nothing, it being evident that there were men yet in and of the world for
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:117749:45"/>whom yet Chriſt prayed, and that was the thing that was aſſerted; <q>whereas he endeavors to prove that thoſe had faith and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs given them, and his prayer was effectual.</q> For forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the ſenſe I have opened it before on <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. I believe it was vouchſafed to them, and I do not judge his prayer ineffectual, they had a forgiveneſs, and letting them eſcape deſerved puniſhment then for that ſin, patience extended, which is to be accounted ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The not falling upon them, and taking ſpeedy vengeance on them, but on the contrary, preaching peace and mercy really to them was <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a relaxation of that bond, and that was the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as I conceive, directly prayed for, ſuch as God often vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed them in former ages, and like that in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.27. 34.35. as was before noted, and they had it; but that they were all after converted and ſaved, that he proves not. Many of them were, that he proves, but not all. He cannot prove one Ruler of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. He brings <hi>Acts</hi> 6.7. to prove it, but that ſayes but the Prieſts, not the chief, or high Prieſts, much leſs Rulers, and yet much leſs that thoſe Prieſts were of the number of his Crucifiers. Prieſts and Rulers in the Scriptures are ſpoken of as diſtinct parties. <hi>Luke</hi> 23.13. and 24.20. Beſides, were any of the Prieſts Rulers, Its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable they were then called the chief Prieſts, but its not ſaid many, or any of them believed. However, this yet concludes that Chriſt there interceded for men in, and of the world, <hi>ut ſupra.</hi> But he hath beſides all theſe Objections, a pretty conceit, not worth the anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſuch a one as we might as well put upon the 17. of <hi>John</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> 
                     <q>of praying as a private man, not as Mediator</q>) and ſo we might ſay, he prayed there as a private man for his friends, not as the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the world, for he ſuppoſes, <q>That Chriſt as a private man might intercede for things that were never granted, but not as Mediator,</q> as if as a private man ſubject to the Law, he would act contrary to his Acts of Mediation, take in whom that rejected, and that in an act of Mediation too. For its evident there he put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf between God, and the people for forgiveneſs. Was it ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heard, that acts of Mediation were excluded the Office of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atorſhip, and looked upon in a Mediator as no acts of his Office? Or can it be ſuppoſed that Chriſt in any thing he (though but as ſubject to the Law) requeſted of God was not heard of him? Did ever a righteous man, guided by the Spirit ask according to the will of God and he denied him? and did Chriſt ask otherwiſe there? Or
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:117749:46"/>was he denied what was ſo asked by him? I might uſe his own words, <hi>Apage has nugas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He goes on to the inſtance of <hi>John</hi> 17.21, 23. In which he ſaies <q>nothing but what we have ſpoken to before, except this, That a conviction of men, that Chriſt is not what they formerly thought him, (and ſo that his people are a people in whom God is, and whom God loves) is not for any good of the world.</q> Which is a very falſe ſaying. For its to the end that they might ſubmit to him, and love his, that they might chuſe the right way, that they might ſee their light and glorifie God. And is that no good to have the right way evidenced and put into their reach? and to have means of glorifying of God afforded to them? Yea, Suppoſe none but the compelled chuſe aright upon this diſcovery (which yet cannot be proved) ſhall we ſay it was not for the others good, becauſe they abuſe it to their harm? Shall Gods goodneſs and Chriſts love be blaſphemed, or deſpiſed and vilified becauſe men abuſe it? Is not this it the Apoſtle faults, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4, 5. <hi>Deſpiſeſt thou the riches of Gods goodneſs, forbearance, and long-ſuffering, not knowing that his goodneſs leads thee to repentance?</hi> becauſe men are not led by it, but ſin againſt it, hardening their hearts, and treaſuring up wrath againſt the day of wrath, ſhall we deſpiſe it too, and make a tuſh of it, and ſay it was not afforded for any good to them? Is it not a good to lead men to Repentance? O let not thoſe that undertake to call men to Repentance, ſo lightly ſpeak of, nay, ſpeak ſo evilly of that they ſhould commend to them; as if themſelves too, and their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them were not for their good! ſpeaking the very language of ungracious hearts, that ſay, if God would have given me grace I would have done better, when they willingly deſpiſed and ſmothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that which God gave them. Might not the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> by this be juſtified in their ſaying, that God did little or nothing for them, nay, he brought them out to deſtroy them, becauſe that did actually befall them for their refuſing to follow him? The Lord ſet it home to mens conſideration, that they believe not Satan, nor nurſe up in their hearts ſlighty eſteems of that goodneſs, that heeded by them would do infinite great good to them. Whereas the Anſwerer alſo alledged, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.15, 16. and <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. as I conceive, onely to prove that Chriſt would have his people uſeful to the world for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincement, (intimated in this expreſſion, <hi>Ye are the ſalt of the earth</hi>) and for drawing in convinced men (intimated in that experſſion,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:117749:46"/>
                     <hi>Ye are the light of the world</hi>) agreable to the end of Chriſts prayer for his called ones in <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.21, 23. and to ſhew that he doth ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede and put in for others then Believers, that he doth in ſome meaſure inlighten every man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> not perceiving his drift in the former proof, ſpeaks impertinently about it, and on the latter bluſters a little too high and too cauſleſly, asking in <hi>what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? how far? into what degree? by whom, and by what means?</hi> &amp;c, as if he would be angry with the expreſſion of Scripture; for that he inlightneth every man that comes into the world is the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaying (a more certain and full expreſſion then that which he ſuborns in the room of it, <hi>viz.</hi> He inlightneth every man that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, which gives an uncertain ſound, and may ſignifie All or Some or almoſt None) only <hi>T.

Now to ask a man in what meaſure, degree, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> is to put a man to ſearch into the ſecrets of God and of every mans heart, to ſee how far the word inſinuates it ſelf into men; I mean Chriſt the word who was in the world, and it knew him not, and came to his own (even before his being made fleſh actually) and they received him not. What underſtanding of God with motions to ſeek him in &amp; by his works and oracles, this word or divine light gave or gives to every man who can diſcloſe, but he whoſe all ſeeing eye knows all things, and he will diſcover that it beamed in ſo much light by one means or other, as that all men when they come to be judged by him ſhall be left without excuſe; and they that have ſubmitted to him ſhall glorifie his goodneſs toward them in the day of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>The ſum of what the Anſwerer further ſaid to the fore-propounded Objection, amounts to this, That as Prieſt, he offered up himſelf to death, and through death as a ſacrifice to God, in which he reſpected diverſe things, &amp; had ſeveral nearer ends ſubordinate to the ultimate,

Now in the firſt conſideration he ſays, he took in All
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:117749:47"/>men; though not all, but his called ones, and ſuch as he ſhould have for his ſeed. In the ſecond, againſt which Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſaith, nothing worth the Anſwer, but faults the things that he ſeems not well to underſtand, and quarrels with want of ſmoothneſs in the expreſſions and unaptneſs of quotations, not rightly taking them to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors meaning as I conceive. For I ſuppoſe <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.9, 26. He only quoted to ſhew that as a Prieſt he offered ſacrifice, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.29. &amp; 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.2. to ſhew that he was as a propitiation, and that extended to All, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14, 15. &amp; <hi>Matt.</hi> 26.26. he quotes to prove his Death to be for Ratification of his Teſtament; and ſo the Apoſtle made uſe of it in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. &amp; 8.32. none of them expreſſing his utmoſt end, that being known ſufficiently and granted on every hand. Now whereas Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſaith, <q>that his proofes for the ſealing the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hold out but the firſt end of the death of Chriſt;</q> he ſpeaks not rightly, for neither of thoſe places (viz. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.26. &amp; <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15.) ſpeaks only of procuring of remiſſion of ſins, or power and prerogative of forgiving, but of ſealing the Teſtament alſo, which bequeaths (not to all he dyed for, but) to all that heartily believe in him (and ſuch the Apoſtles were) the receit and injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of forgiveneſs, and of the inheritance it ſelf, which remiſſion the believers indeed confeſs that they experimentally receive from him in his blood believed on by them (<hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25.) as in <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7. &amp; <hi>Col.</hi> 1.14. which Scriptures ſpeak not of procuring Redemption (though that muſt needs be ſuppoſed as a thing fore-done) but of the receit and injoyment of it, that they being brought out of darkneſs into Chriſts Government, met with, and partook of, as the word <gap reason="foreign">

Is there not a plain difference between theſe two, the breaking in peices the bond of Death man was faln into, and ſo delivering him out of that; and the making a Covenant of promiſes with ſome of them ſo ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomed? Is it all one for a Prince to ranſom a thouſand men out of priſon, in which they were to periſh, and ſave them from hanging when the rope was about their necks, And his entring into a bond and Covenant to prefer ſo many of them being ranſomed as will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to, and ſerve him? Did not Chriſt undertake for both in his death? both to ranſom man faln, and to confirm his Church in faith? But who can give eyes? or who ſhall perſwade wiſe men to be willing to be fools in themſelves that God may give them eyes? I ſhall leave the Reader to God, intreating ſobriety from him, and that he will not wink with his eye willfully when light is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to him.

                  <p n="1">1. Gods Glory, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.11.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nextly the glory of the Son of God, that he might have the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence, and God be glorified in him, <hi>John.</hi> 17.1, 4. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9, 10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9. To this end he both dyed, and roſe, and revived, that he might be Lord of quick and dead. So <hi>John</hi> 5.22. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath given to the Son to have life in himſelf (which I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand of the life communicable to men, for that is ſaid to be in him, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.11. and ſo life in him through his death for men) that all men ſhould honor the Son even as they honor the Father; for thats the life indeed for which he is ſo worthy to be honored of all men, in their looking to him, and believing on him as on the Father;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:117749:48"/>and thats the honoring him as the Father, to give him all the honor of believing and ſtaying on him, reſting and glorying in him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging his Lordſhip, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> as to the Father.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To theſe purpoſes that all might be ſet free and ranſomed from the ſentence of death under which they were fallen, that ſo God and Chriſt might be glorified in them all, and an object of hope and faith be provided for them to look to and believe in for ſalvation, and for God to glorifie the riches of his mercy in drawing men to according to his good pleaſure, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.28. &amp; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14, 15.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That thoſe that believe in him might have eternal life.

                  <p>But that that was his end that Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> propounds towards the concluſion of his 1. <hi>Chap</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> 
                     <q>That All and every one of them for whom Chriſt dyed, ſhould have All thoſe things conferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, that he procured for any; or that they All ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be brought to God and to eternal glory) I deny, and leave for him to prove, which there he doth not.</q> But let us ſee if he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove none of the ends laid down by me.</p>
                  <p>He tels us (<hi>Chap.</hi> 2.) that it was not meerly his own Good he aimed at in his death. That it was not meerly his own is without doubt, but that it was alſo his own glory to be manifeſted is as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and therefore alſo he prays the Father for that, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.4, 5. but he ſays further, "While he was in the way he merited nothing for himſelf. Whereas the holy ones of God have deemed him wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to receive honor and glory, power and riches,
<note place="margin">Rev. 5.9.</note> wiſdom and ſtrength for that his ſuffering <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and I think God judged him ſo too, for as a reward of his ſufferings he hath given it him; and that Chriſt had no eye at that in regard of his humanity (as he inſinuates) is not to be believed, ſeeing the Apoſtle expreſſes he had, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14 9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. he procured the exaltation of his humane nature (and the manifeſtation of his glory as the word of God more brightly) by his ſufferings, and that God predeſtinated it to that glory otherwiſe then by ſufferings, I no where finde, nor I think he neither. Its true, that was not the onely thing, nor perhaps the main thing in his eye,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:117749:49"/>He aimed more at the glorifying of his Father, and that the world through him might be ſaved; but that <q>That was not in his eye, nor procured meritoriouſly by him,</q> and ſo no end aimed at by him in making ſatisfaction for ſin, ſeem ſtrange poſitions, and yet theſe are Mr. <hi>Owens</hi> Conceptions and Concluſions, quite croſs to that of <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9. before mentioned.</p>
                  <p>Sure if he procured any thing meritoriouſly of the Father, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured his own exaltation in the humane nature, eſpecially that glory of it to be the habitation and ſtorehouſe of that fulneſs that he hath for us, which to me is more plain then that it may be denied in that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.18. <hi>He led captivity captive, and received gifts in the man;</hi> and in <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. its (<gap reason="foreign">

                     </q> ver. 7, 8. He errs again, when he ſaith, The Dominion he hath over All, is not founded on his Death, for the Scripture ſaith expreſly to this end he died (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) that he might have Dominion, and for this cauſe God highly exalted him, becauſe he humbled himſelf, and bare the ſins of many, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.12. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.10, 11. But Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſeems here to leap over hedge and ditch to his own purpoſes, not conſidering how full the Scriptures are againſt him. And indeed how can we expect a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of Scripture to diſprove a Scripture Aſſertion? But let us "ſee how he confirms his opinion. He indeavors it from <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. He was appointed heir of all things. But what then? In what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was he ſo appointed? Sure he needed no appointment or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution for his Divine Nature, ſeeing Dominion over all was eſſential to that. If in the Humane Nature united to the Divine, then through what way was he appointed to become heir? was it not the ſame in which he was begotten to be his Son? and is it not ſaid of him upon his Reſurrection in that regard, <hi>Thou art my Son, "this day have I begotten thee?</hi> then he was begotten in the Humane Nature, to poſſeſſion of the Divine Glory. Beſides, may it not as well follow, that therefore he purchaſed no glory for his Elect, for they were appointed, &amp; preordained to it too, before the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world. So that this is proofleſs to that particular. "His next is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.7, 8. <hi>God hath put all things under his feet.</hi> But doth he not ſpeak of that as a conſequent to his abaſement; <hi>Thou madeſt him lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle lower then the Angels, thou crownedſt him with glory and honor,</hi> &amp;c?
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:117749:49"/>And expreſly in <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>We ſee Jeſus for the ſuffering of Death crowned with glory and honor.</hi> I marvel what could make him quote this place of all the reſt, it being rather full againſt him.</p>
                  <p>"He asks if Chriſt died for all thoſe things that are ſubject to him? <hi>Sed quid hoc ad Rhombum?</hi> Its enough that he died that he might have ſuch dominion over them, which he hath partly by dying for them (as in men) and partly by conqueſt over them (as in the devils) and partly by gift, as a reward of his ſervice performed by him to his Father, as in all things, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.10, 11. "Again, He asks if he have not dominion over the Angels? (Yes, and what then?) "But he died not for them. True, but what then? Did he not die, that through death his Humane nature might be taken up into glory, tranſcending theirs? But he ſayes, All things "are rather given him out of the Immediate love of the Father? What he means here by Immediate I well know not, if that without conſideration of his death and ſufferings, the forecited Scriptures ſay enough againſt him. If he mean onely that that was the bottom-fountain of his giving all to him: Then doth he not ſee how by that manner of reaſoning, he alſo overthrows the effect of Chriſts death that he pleads for, in procuring grace and glory for his choſen, for by the ſame reaſon he purchaſed not that neither, nor eyed it, they flowing from the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the good pleaſure and love of God, as is declared at large, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4, 5, 6, 7. and 2.4, 5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Certainly in all this Argument he hath horribly miſtaken.</p>
                  <p>But yet at length he ſayes. <q>Suppoſe this be true, What proof follows from thence of the general Ranſom, ſeeing this Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a power of condemning as well as ſaving? and its not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to aſſert, that Chriſt died to Redeem them, that he might have power to condemn them; nay, if he died to Redeem them, then he aimed not at any ſuch power to condemn them.</q> To this I onely ſay. 1. We ground not our Aſſertion of the generality of the Ranſom upon this bottom meerly, but upon plainer teſtimonies alſo; onely we aſſert this end. 2. We ſay, at the power of ſaving or condemning them he aimed, though not at their condemnation. And that <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9. proves. He had not power over them to ſave them, nor were there any juſt ground for their looking to him for ſalvation (as the caſe ſtood) he not dying to ranſom them from the power of that condemnation that was already paſſed upon them, therefore that he might be able to ſave them, and he, and God in
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:117749:50"/>him be a fit object for them to look to for it, to that end he died for them, <hi>John</hi> 3.17. though tis true, that by the ſame he is able alſo to judge and condemn them for neglecting and rejecting him and his ſalvation, which he could not reaſonably be thought to have had, if there had been no ſalvation in him, or way to ſalvation opened to them by him, and ſo his power to condemn, yea his actual condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them had not been with ſo much ſubſerviency to the higheſt end of all, Gods glory manifeſted: Gods glory had been leſs glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly manifeſted in condemning men for their ſin in another meerly, the ſin of the publike man, then for their perſonal abuſes, neglects, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſals, and wilful rebellions againſt grace afforded perſonally to them, which they had no way to obtain but through his ſufferings to ranſom them from deſtruction in their former ſentence of condemnation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another end rejected by him is this. <q>That Gods Juſtice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſatisfied he might ſave ſinners.</q> In which, in effect, He either denies that Chriſt died to make ſatisfaction to Gods Juſtice (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his after diſcourſe againſt the <hi>Socinians,</hi> and his Chapter about Satisfaction) or that that ſatisfaction was any means of the ſalvation of ſinners,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 7.8, 9.</note> or at beſt a needleſs means, for God might otherwiſe have ſaved them. None of which he proveth. <q>Now whereas he adds that the <hi>Arminians</hi> ſay, that after the ſatisfaction made by Chriſt, <hi>Deo integrum fuit,</hi> it was freely in Gods diſpoſe whether to ſave any or no:</q> I ſhall paſs it, as wholly impertinent, either to what I have laid down as the ends of Chriſts death, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. or to the Poſition here rejected by him, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt died, that Gods Juſtice being ſatisfied he might ſave ſinners. For this adds alſo, he might, or might not ſave any one ſinner. Which that Poſition ſaid not. But he further lays down this Poſition. <q>That it was not to procure any thing to God, but to obtain all good things to us.</q> But how agrees this with thoſe Scriptures, that ſay. He bought us by his blood to God,
<note place="margin">Rev. 5.9. Act. 20.28</note> and God purchaſed a Church by it to himſelf? Will M. <hi>Owen</hi> exclude theſe acts from being in Gods intention in giving Chriſt to die; or doth he think <hi>[<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s]</hi> the Church to be nothing? Beſides, what need, I pray, of obtaining any good to us, if God was equally at liberty to diſpenſe thoſe good things to us without his dying, as through it, notwithſtanding his ſentence of condemnation fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed, and that the ſupream end aimed at was to be accompliſhed? (for we ſpeak not of ſatisfying Juſtice, or opening a way for Gods goodneſs to flow forth without conſideration, either of the ſentence
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:117749:50"/>requiring ſatisfaction, or the end of God in glorifying his Juſtice, for how then ſhould we make it a ſubordinate end thereto?) in which his firſt argument is anſwered. We ſay, if that ſentence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſed, He could otherwiſe have ſaved man, and given him all good things, then is the Death of Chriſt evacuated, no need of him to have obtained any thing of God, God from eternity loving them, and being free to give them all good things, and his juſtice as well diſpenſing with ſin unſatisfied for, as requiring ſatisfaction; but this he declines the aſſerting of.</p>
                  <p>His ſecond Argument being only againſt that clauſe, That God might ſave none notwithſtanding that ſatisfaction, I paſs over, as nothing againſt our Aſſertions. In his third, He ſays that then <q>Chriſt ſhould be ſaid rather to redeem a liberty to God then to us from evil, to enlarge God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> To that I ſay, He hath in a manner confeſſed himſelf, that he dyed ſupreamly to make way for the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of Gods glory, for what elſe is it to manifeſt his glory, as if otherwiſe it would have lain more hid, and could not have ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, had not Chriſt dyed? and then doth not this abſurdity lie as much upon himſelf as us? We ſay, but <hi>(Poſito Decreto)</hi> God having decreed to have no fellowſhip with ſinners, nor to diſpenſe favor to their perſons but through ſatisfaction for their ſins, he could not act forth the manifeſtations of his glorious grace but through ſatisfaction; and he ſays the ſame, otherwiſe he will make it but a needleſs means to the ſupream end, the manifeſtation of his glory. And yet from neither his ſaying nor ours, is it meet to ſay that Chriſt dyed to redeem a liberty to God rather then to redeem us, for he was in no real bondage in himſelf, nor ever a whit the leſs glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in himſelf had he bound up himſelf for ever from doing us good: but ours would have been the bondage and miſery, that thereby ſhould have been debarred from experimenting his goodneſs upon us to eternity, his love to us led him to think it as a ſtrait (as it did to <hi>Ephraim, Hoſ.</hi> 11.8.) but that was becauſe his love made ours his. What he ſaith about the merit of Chriſt, we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak to more fully afterward, in anſwer to <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. <hi>lib.</hi> 3. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>lib.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>His next argument alſo (being againſt the aſſigning that as All the end of the death of Chriſt, ſo as that being accompliſhed none might be ſaved) intrenches not upon us, as is manifeſt by what I laid down in the beginning of this Chapter.</p>

                  <p>"That Chriſt is given for a Covenant (as is afterward affirmed by him) I believe, and that alſo as a Covenant, is propounded (in reſpect of future benefit) conditionally to men upon ſubmiſſion and obedience, is as true. See this latter in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.3, 4, 5. Hear, and your ſouls ſhall live, and I will make an everlaſting Covenant with you: here is the promiſe of making that Covenant (even the ſure mercies of <hi>David,</hi> which is Chriſt dead and riſen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) but its upon this condition; hear and then your ſouls ſhall live, and I will make it with you; thence men that take hold on Chriſt by faith, take hold on the Covenant, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.6. the former is propounded, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.6.

                  <p>"His after-denying that Chriſts death effected a liberty to God of doing that, which otherwiſe his juſtice by vertue of his ſentence of puniſhing the ſinner, would have hindred him from doing, is as much as if he ſhould ſay, That Chriſt dyed in vain, and without any need, for he might have manifeſted his juſtice and his mercy as much in his dealings with the ſons of men, if Chriſt had never dyed in ſtead of them; which if it be not to make the Death of Chriſt an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary, ſupervacaneous thing, I know not what is.</p>

                  <p>HE proceeds in the next place to application, and to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate this Aſſertion, <q>That Jeſus Chriſt according to the Councel and will of his Father, did offer himſelf on the croſs, to the procurement of eternal ſalvation, with all the branches and means of it, and makes continual Interceſſion with this intent and purpoſe, that all the good things ſo procured by his death might be actually and infallibly beſtowed on, and applyed to All and every one for whom he dyed, according to the will and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God.</q> A poſition manifeſtly falſe, for then we muſt all be Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, Paſtors and Teachers, nay have a

                  <p n="1">1. <q>From Scriptures holding out the intention and counſel of God.</q>
                  </p>

                  <p n="3">3. <q>From thoſe that point out the perſons for whom Chriſt dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. His prevarications and weakneſs in the pointing out and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from each of which, we ſufficiently ſhewed in our anſwer to the firſt Chapter of his firſt Book, and therefore here ſhall add only this, That his arguments run but to this purpoſe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Some one ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate end of Chriſts death only agrees to ſome, therefore he dyed only for thoſe, and with no reſpect to the ſupream end dyed for any other; and ſo by conſequence God hath no glory brought to him by the death of Jeſus Chriſt, but only in and from the Elect; and Chriſt hath got no glory from any other but them, he leaving them as he found them, and doing nothing in his mediation for them. Truly God and Chriſt are not beholding to Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> for his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. So again, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Believers have had ſuch and ſuch effects in and by the death of Chriſt believed in by them, therefore he dyed only for them; like this, ſuch as go to a feaſt are well refreſhed by eating it, therefore it was made for no more then them that go to it: or this, Such priſoners being ranſomed and following the Prince that ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomed them, met with ſuch bounty from him, Therefore he ranſomed none but them. And again, Many were ranſomed, <hi>Ergo,</hi> not All. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> God made <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Therefore he made no body elſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but no more to them arguments, only there are diverſe paſſages in the latter part of this <hi>Chapter</hi> from <hi>p.</hi> 79. that we have not ſpoken to, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall take them in here, As,</q>

                  <p>
                     <q>He denies that the death of Chriſt in any place of Scripture is ſaid to be for all men. For Anſwer to which, I deſire the Reader to turn to 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5, 6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. I know his objection is elſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, that the word Men is not in the original. To which I anſwer firſt, That by the ſame reaſon he may ſay that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12.

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:117749:52"/>becauſe the whole precedent ſpeech was about men, All men to be prayed for, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. and expreſly, <hi>verſe</hi> 4. that God would have All men to be ſaved <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that demonſtrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this, that there is but one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Chriſt Jeſus, who gave himſelf a ranſom for All. For All what? muſt it not needs be men, between whom and God he is a Mediator, and whom he tels us God would have to be ſaved, All men; and ſo in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. was not the Apoſtle admiring Gods goodneſs to man? Lord what is man, and the Son of man? exalting man above all his works, which is now verified in one Man Jeſus that dyed for every one; What can it be referred to as before ſpoken about, but man, or the ſons of men? But of this we ſhall have cauſe to ſpeak further hereafter.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That there are more ends of the death of Jeſus Chriſt then what is the immediate fruit of it by way of ranſome and propitiation before faith in it, we have ſhewed in the concluſion of the firſt Book, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his firſt Chapter of the ſecond. Some fruits there are of it from God towards men before faith, and while in ſtate of unbelief, as the opening the door for entrance, and for exhortations to ſtrive to enter, a feaſt prepared in Chriſt, and a way of participating of it made, and invitations vouchſafed, as in <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.4. <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.3, 4, 5. <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.24. and thoſe for and to more then enter and eat: other fruits there are of it that flow in upon faith, as ſatisfaction, juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſanctification, the contents of the new Teſtament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And he that cannot ſee theſe to be diſtinct fruits, and produced for or upon diverſe objects, and objects diverſly conſidered, is blinde and cannot ſee afar off, nor into the things evidently held forth in the Goſpel; And what the ranſome either immediately with God and for men, or mediately upon and in men produceth, were ſubordinate ends and aimes that Chriſt had in his eye upon his death, as Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alſo implies, when he makes the ends of Chriſts death to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incident with its effects; His following obſervation objected againſt that, that where the word <hi>many</hi> is uſed, there are more ends of Chriſts death mentioned; I ſhall paſs it, being not material, and in ſome paſſages at leaſt doubtful.</p>
                  <p>But in <hi>page</hi> 80. To this exception of ours, Chriſts death is not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to many, and to his ſheep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the ranſome and propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as if he dyed for them only; he tels us,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <q>That Chriſt ſaying he dyed for his ſheep and Church, and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:117749:52"/>Scripture witneſſing that all are not his ſheep, they conclude and argue by undeniable conſequence, that he dyed not for thoſe that are not ſo.</q> At which aſſertion I can but wonder; when firſt I heard of Mr. <hi>Owens</hi> Book, he was ſo commended to me for a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putant, that I could not expect any ſuch lame arguments from him: If we muſt take his ſaying of a thing to be an infallible proof, that its ſo, then we have done with him; but ſure no Logick rule or good reaſon that I have ever met with can prove this aſſertion. Had he ſaid, Chriſt ſaying he dyed for his ſheep, and the Scripture ſaying all are not his ſheep, it argues that in that ſaying he extended not the ſpeech there about his Death to All, he had ſpoken reaſon; but to argue, that becauſe he mentions no more there as the object of his Death, therefore he had no greater object of his death, is as great an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence as any can be. Let it be conſidered by this like reaſoning, God ſtiles himſelf the Creator of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and their King,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 43.11.</note> 
                     <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.15. but many places of Scripture witneſs that All are not <hi>Iſrael,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he did not Create all men, nor is King of all the earth, contrary to <hi>Acts</hi> 17.24, 25, 26. &amp; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 47.7. So again in <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.7. God is ſtiled the Saviour of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the time of trouble, but All are not <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Therefore he is not the Saviour of All men, contrary to 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. Or like this, God Created the Smith that blows in the fire, and that brings forth the inſtrument for his work, and the waſter to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy: but all are not ſuch, <hi>Ergo</hi> God created not All <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.16. What rational man, much leſs a Scholar would call theſe undeniable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences? but let us obſerve what ſtrong proofs he brings to back it. He tels us that in that very place Chriſt preſently adds, that ſome are not of his ſheep, which if it be not equivalent to his ſheep only, he knows not what is. Now that <hi>[preſently]</hi> is in <hi>ver.</hi> 26. and the other <hi>ver.</hi> 15. ſo that there are eleven <hi>verſes</hi> diſtance between them, and in the interim there is a Chafma, a breaking off that diſcourſe in <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. and the following <hi>verſes,</hi> See <hi>ver.</hi> 19, 20, 21. and a new oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the following diſcourſe mentioned in <hi>ver.</hi> 22, 23, 24. ſo that the latter in <hi>verſ.</hi> 26. might be ſpoken at another time, many hours or dayes after the former: but however, ſuppoſe them ſpoken within two or three verſes diſtance, what doth that prove? that he dyed for his ſheep only? juſt as much as Gods mentioning the <hi>Babilonians</hi> and <hi>Caldeans</hi> in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.14. the verſe next before his ſaying (I am the Creator of <hi>Iſrael</hi>) proves that he created not the <hi>Babilonians;</hi> What wilde reaſoning is this? It ſhews indeed that (which we deny not)
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:117749:53"/>there he ſpeaks of no more then his ſheep, not that therefore he dyed for no more then his ſheep, eſpecially as the propitiation, there he ſaith not he died for all, not there he denies that he dyed for All. As when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>He loved me, and gave himſelf for me,</hi> he ſpeaks but of himſelf there, but it follows not from thence, that he denied his loving any but him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I might retort here his own lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, in <hi>lin.</hi> 24.25. of <hi>pag.</hi> 81. but I have enough to do beſide, I pray God help him to ſee that the beam is in his own eye while he cries out of the mote in his brothers. Let any but rationally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare what is objected againſt him, <hi>pag.</hi> 81. and his anſwers to it, <hi>pag.</hi> 82. and he may well admire the anſwers.</p>
                  <p>For whereas its objected, That our Saviour did not in <hi>John</hi> 10. ſet forth any difference between ſuch as he died for, and ſuch as he died not for. He anſwers, that there is there an evident diſtinction, and that he called them he died for, his Sheep (juſt as God calls them he created, <hi>Iſrael</hi>) thoſe that he would give eternal life to, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now I would Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> would ſhew us the other part of the diſtinction, where Chriſt in any part of the Chapter ſaies, But ſome there are that I will not die for, and they are ſuch and ſuch. There Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> fails. In the firſt diſcourſe Chriſt onely tells us how he loved his ſheep more then other Shepheards that are hirelings, and who are his ſheep, but not a word that he died onely for them ſheep, by way of ranſom and propitiation. Nor indeed ſpeaks he there of dying (at leaſt not meerly) in that conſideration, but as a ſhepheard op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to other ſhepheards that are hirelings, who will not lay down their lives for the flocks committed to them, but flee. Were they hired think we to ranſom, or be a propitiation for the ſheep, and are any faulted for running away, and not doing that? Surely God never required that of any but Chriſt, nor faulted any for declining it. But they were hired to teach, lead, ſtand by, ſupport and go before their flocks, in witneſſing the truth againſt ravenous Wolves, and Perſecutors, not to run away in times of danger, and leave their flocks to ſhift for themſelves; for not dying for the ſheep in this ſenſe he faults the hirelings, and in that properly he there oppoſes himſelf to them in laying down his life for witneſſing the Truth preached, and ſtrengthning them for ſufferings. So that he not onely limits not the ranſom here to his ſheep, but ſpeaks of his laying down his life alſo, to a quite other purpoſe then Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> produceth it to prove. What follows in him, is not pertinent to prove, that
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:117749:53"/>either he ſpeaks there of dying for them by way of propitiation, or (much leſs) that he ſo died onely for them. <q>Indeed he tells us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately, that all thoſe for whom he died, he died for them in the ſame manner, and to the ſame end, and that he died for none but thoſe that ſhall be brought in by the Miniſtration of the Goſpel.</q> But theſe are things often ſpoken, but never proved, and often diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. He tells us alſo that the <q>Primary difference there, is not between believers, and not believers, but between ſheep and not ſheep; in which he alſo miſtaketh.</q> For though in his after diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe he puts a difference between ſheep and not ſheep, believers and not believers; yet in that former diſcourſe in which he ſpeaks of laying down his life, there is no difference aimed at between ſheep and not ſheep, but between ſhepheard and ſhepheards, the good ſhepheard and the hireling, in their entrance to the care of the flock, and deportment toward them. Let that be but warily conſidered, and it will give further light to our underſtanding of the place, and clearly cut off that exception. He ſayes again, That "the queſtion is not at all to what end Chriſt mentions his Death. But there he is out too; for it pertains much to the queſtion; for if he mentions it as an example to other ſhepheards under him, then he mentions it not as the propitiation, for in that we are not to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, nor can we. But he ſaith, <q>His intention is to declare his giving his life a ranſom,</q> 
                     <hi>ver.</hi> 18. but that ſaith not any ſuch thing, but onely that he laid down his life, and took it up again. And though he ſhould include the buſineſs of Ranſom and propitiation in that 18 <hi>verſe,</hi> yet taking in the other thing too, <hi>viz.</hi> the Teſtimony-bearing to his Doctrine, and ſo the preſervation of his ſheep in the faith, it makes the thing impertinent to our purpoſe. For our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy is not, whom he died to eſtabliſh in the faith, but whom he died for, to ranſom them from the ſentence upon them in <hi>Adam.</hi> Again, Though he ſay not that he laid down his life to give us example, yet ſpeaking of it as done by him, as a ſhepheard over the flock, with oppoſition to hirelings that leave the flock, he tacitely inſtructs us, what he would have other good ſhepheards do, and ſo tacitely propounds himſelf as an example to us, To which may be added this, That the ſheep of another fold (whether people ſeeking after God in other Nations not yet gathered into unity with theſe believing <hi>Jews,</hi> or others yet to be called, its diſputable) ſeem to be ſpoken of as a diſtinct people from thoſe for whom he ſayes he laid
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:117749:54"/>down his life, as not pertaining to his miniſtration as on the earth, and ſo not ſo concerned in his Death, as a ſhepheard for confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſtrengthning of them by the view of his conſtancy in the faith believed, as theſe ſheep were. The phraſe is remarkable, That ſo ſoon as he had ſaid, <hi>I laid down my life for the ſheep,</hi> he adds, <hi>And other ſheep alſo I have that are not of this Fold.</hi> Others, from what? but thoſe he had been ſpeaking of that the Father had immediatly put under his charge, in point of his vocal and perſonal Miniſtration. For whoſe incouragement alſo in the firſt place, he laid down his life, witneſſing a good confeſſion before <hi>Pontius Pilate.</hi> But I leave that to judicious conſiderations. Again, If by ſheep not of this fold, be meant ſuch <hi>Gentiles</hi> as God had drawn to ſeek after him, by thoſe meanes of his goodneſs ſpread abroad amongſt them, though not yet led ſo far as to know and acknowledge, or walk with Chriſt and his Diſciples of the <hi>Jews</hi> (ſuch as <hi>Cornelius</hi> and ſome of his family were, and others ſuch might be) as I ſee nothing to diſprove it, Then Mr. <hi>Owens</hi> Allegation of that afterward to prove, That the word ſheep contains others, then thoſe that are in ſome degree be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers or fearers of God, falls to the ground. But however, take it one way or other, it nothing diſproves the main controverted point. <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt died not for his ſheep onely.</p>
                  <p>I paſs other following contentions, not directly pertinent; onely note, That where (in <hi>pag.</hi> 85.) <q>He ſaies he knows not where its ſaid, For All men, but is ſure that Chriſt is ſaid to give his life a ranſom, and that onely mentioned, when it is not ſaid for All, as <hi>Matt.</hi> 20.28. and 10.45.</q> (I ſuppoſe it ſhould be, and <hi>Mark</hi> 10.45.) his words are ambiguous, for either he means that its only mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a ranſom, where the word [All] is not joyned with it, or where its not extended to All: and if ſo, then ſpeaks he evidently falſe, for in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. its in expreſs tearms, <hi>He gave himſelf a ranſom for All;</hi> or elſe that Chriſt is ſaid to give himſelf a ranſom, and nothing men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, but that in ſome places where its not ſaid for All. But then he trifles too. For if it be ſaid but in one place <hi>[for All]</hi> its enough for our faith to cloſe in with, there being no one place that denies it of any; and many being neither a limitation of, nor contradiction to All, as is evident. To ſay nothing that there his Mediation and Miniſtration are joyned together. To Miniſter and give his life a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom for many.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Whereas in the concluſion of that Chapter, he charges M. <hi>Moore,</hi>
                        <pb n="69" facs="tcp:117749:54"/>with framing an objection like a man of clouts, to which none of his Adverſaries did ever contribute a penful of Ink. I ſhall ſay no more but this,</q> That to my remembrance, I ſaw a writing ſent him, containing four Objections, the ſame in matter and form as are there laid down in his book, in the beginnings of his 14, 15, 16, and 17. Chapters. And as I remember they were ſent him by one <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund Scottin</hi> of <hi>Emmith</hi> neer to <hi>Wiſbitch.</hi> So that therein Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> doth falſely aſperſe him, being guilty himſelf of as weak Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as any one of them, As may appear by this of dying for his ſheep: to which I have been laſtly ſpeaking.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>HIs next Chapter is about Impetration and Application. About which I ſhall firſt propound my underſtanding, and then conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what is ſaid by him, Thus then I conceive the Scripture to hold forth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Jeſus Chriſt by his Death and Sacrifice impetrated, procured, and obtained a releaſe of all men from being dealt with according to that ſentence of condemnation that paſſed upon them for the tranſgreſſion of <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo as that they ſhould not be cut off and deſtroyed properly for that: (As <hi>Moſes</hi> by his mediation for <hi>Iſrael</hi> procured a repeal, or reverſion of that ſentence pronounced againſt them in <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.11, 12. of ſmiting them by Peſtilence, and diſinheriting them, <hi>ver.</hi> 19, 20.) This I gather from <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Jeſus Chriſt by his death and Sacrifice impetrated, procured, or obtained power and Lordſhip to himſelf in the man, over them all, and all things concerning them, Angels, Devils, and all creatures made for them, that he ſhould have power over them, to rule or order them, and make them, uſeful and ſerviceable to all, or any man, or for chaſtiſement and correction to them, as he pleaſes. This I ground upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.36. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That he procured and obtained thereby to have in himſelf in the Humane Nature all fulneſs of gifts and grace, life and ſalvation,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:117749:55"/>ſo as that it might be diſpenſed unto all or any man in that way God and he ſhould propound for participation thereof, which (in regard of the eternal life and ſalvation) is only by receit of himſelf, ſo as that it ſhould not paſs from him dividedly from himſelf, but men muſt come in to him, and receive him, to receive and injoy that fulneſs in him. And this I ground upon thoſe Scriptures, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.18. Aſcending up on high, and leading captivity captive, he received gifts in the Man, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.11. God hath given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son (whence alſo as thus filled, he is the Bread and Tree of life) He that hath him, hath this life, and he that hath not him, hath not life, <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. He may impart and give other gifts to men that are apart from him and not in him, but the main gift, the life in him, he gives injoyment of only to men in him, ſo that if men would have it, they muſt go to him for it; though the ſervants are ſent abroad, and he comes forth with them to call men to the feaſt, yet men muſt go into him by Faith, and receive him into their hearts, elſe they have not the efficacy of the feaſt prepared for them in him; but he hath impetrated to have life in himſelf and fulneſs fit for All or any to look to him for, and communicable by him to all or any in looking to him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He hath alſo impetrated and obtained, that the ingagement of God to him ſhould be fulfilled, he having performed his Fathers will, he hath obliged God (as we may ſo ſay) upon his promiſe to give him a ſeed, and to that end ſo to glorifie him with himſelf and to men, and ſo to exerciſe his power and goodneſs amongſt them, that Nations and people ſhould run in to him, and ſo come to injoy the life thats in him, and glory with him, leaving that (ſo far as I finde) to his Fathers goodwill, whom and how many ſo to cauſe to run un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, not doubting but he will make good his word to his ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. Thus for his Impetration.</p>
                  <p>Now accordingly by way of Application (if we may ſo call it) He and God in him,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Deals with all men in a way of mercy, bounty, and goodneſs, and not according to the Tenor of the firſt obligation, or the curſe deſerved by their ſin in <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hath inveſted him with ſupream Authority over All Creatures, giving all things into his hands, and he rules the Nations with a rod of Iron, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and diſpenſes to them as ſeems good to him. And,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hath life in himſelf, free for, and communicable to All or any,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:117749:55"/>which he makes over to his people brought into him, forgiving their ſins, ſanctifying their ſouls, putting into them his ſpirit, laws, fear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> changing them into his likeneſs, till he bring them into the full poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of all his glory. And,</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Father glorifies him amongſt men, and ſo works in his word and providences by his Spirit, that he hath a Church and Spouſe, a ſeed given him, to whom he doth impart that fulneſs that is in him; and executes his Lordly office amongſt the reſt according to his and the Fathers will, ſo as that he brings about the main end of his ſufferings, the glory of God, in all his diſpenſations even toward them alſo. And theſe are my thoughts about this diſtinction.</p>
                  <p>Some make uſe of a Diſtinction of a Reconcilation wrought in Chriſt for men, and in men by Chriſt; the firſt for all men, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond in all cordial and through-believers. Which I make out and approve thus.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The nature of man was fully and perfectly reconciled to God in the perſon of Chriſt by his death, for All men, or in the behalf of, and for the benefit of all men. The nature of man (though the Word deſcended into it and was made Fleſh, yet) as it was given in the behalf of other mens perſons (yea he in it as the publike ſinner) to ranſom all, ſo between it in Chriſt and God there was a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, and that ſo great, that God fell upon it, wounded, bruiſed, afflicted, yea curſed it, as I may ſay, or made it accurſed, and his Son as in it, pouring upon it the puniſhment of the ſin of man before he took it up into his glory: but having done ſo, to the utmoſt of his will not ſparing him, he then raiſed it,
<note place="margin">Acts 13.33.</note> took it up into Sonſhip with the Word, and filled it with all his fulneſs, being at perfect unity with it, and it with him, never more to be at odds again; here is a full, compleat, and perfect reconciliation of the nature of man in Chriſts perſon, and this for All, as the puniſhment was ſuffered in ſtead of the whole nature in its ſeveral individuals, and ſo as that God now lets go all other from executing the fierceneſs of his wrath upon them for that ſin in which they formerly ſtood condemned, and calls for ſatisfaction to his juſtice in that point from none of them,
<note place="margin">Rom. 2.4, 5.</note> but extends ſuch means and goodneſs to them as leadeth to Repentance. Yet in their perſons they are not reconciled, they all (except the man Chriſt) remain in enmity againſt him, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man in all our perſons is ſuch, that with no one of mankinde can ſo holy a God have fellowſhip, till ſomething be done to them,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:117749:56"/>that is <hi>(De adultis loquor)</hi> till there be wrought in them a renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of themſelves and ſins, and a willingneſs to walk with God through his love and goodneſs, which none have in them meerly by Chriſts dying for them, and aſcending to God, till ſomething be wrought in them from heaven by his Spirit:
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 14.24, 28.</note> Till when, men are like <hi>Abſolom,</hi> when <hi>David</hi> at <hi>Joabs</hi> mediation took of the ſentence of his baniſhment, but yet would not let him ſee his face. All yet in that regard children of wrath, worthy of wrath, though God deal not with them according to deſert, nor goes about to execute the fierceneſs of wrath upon them, but on the contrary affords them means of ſeeking him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to ſome more, to ſome leſs, as he pleaſes. But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When the goodneſs of God,
<note place="margin">Pſa. 36.7, 8. Eph. 1.13.</note> and the operations of his Word and Spirit, the inſinuations of divine light and love into the hearts of any is ſo received and yielded to, that they are brought to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentence and faith in God and Chriſt, and ſubmiſſion to his Spirit, then they come in their own perſons to be reconciled, to receive the reconciliation and atonement; then God begins to own and walk with them,
<note place="margin">Rom. 5.11.</note> and take them up into unity and fellowſhip with his Son: and this is the reconciliation wrought in men by Chriſt, to which the Apoſtle exhorts in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20.</p>
                  <p>How much my ſenſe of theſe diſtinctions differ from the <hi>Arminians, Camero's, Teſtardus</hi> and others (who as M. <hi>Owen</hi> tels us, all ſpeak of an Impetration of Reconciliation, Remiſſion, Redemption, conditional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if they believe) I leave to their Judgments that compare us. M. <hi>Owens</hi> arguments againſt that firſt diſtinction, as uſed by them, make nothing againſt me, I affirming an application or donation from the Father to be made to Chriſt, and through Chriſt to men, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the purpoſe of his Impetration: only ſome paſſages in his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments would be ſpoken to; as whereas in his ſecond Argument <hi>p.</hi> 89. he affirms, that whatſoever is obtained for any, is theirs by right for whom it is obtained. I think that is not every way true. I may purchaſe a picee of land intentionally for my childe, and yet keep the right and title in my own hand ſo that he may not have right in it, or title to it, till I actually inſtate him in it. Whatever the thoughts of Chriſt were to any in dying for them, yet we are not made heirs till brought into him; till then we have no right either to claim, or to receive the promiſes, <hi>Ye are all the ſons of God by faith in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and if Chriſts, then <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, and heirs according to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:117749:56"/>promiſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.29. So <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.6. being juſtified by grace, we are made heirs according to the hope of eternal life. Whether the condition of faith be purchaſed or no, we ſhall view elſewhere,</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Again, in his third Argument, he tels us that theſe two, Impetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Application,</q> are alwayes joyned together in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: in which he ſaith not truly, for I demand where is the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. He gave himſelf a ranſom for All, or in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. by the grace of God he might taſt death for every one? and where is the impetration in that, <hi>By him whoſoever believes ſhall receive the remiſſion of ſins? Acts</hi> 10.43. He hath alſo diverſe indirect and vitious inferences, as when from <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11. <q>[<hi>He ſhall juſtifie many for he ſhall bear their iniquities</hi>]</q> he infers, All whoſe ſins he bare, he alſo juſtifieth, whenas ſuch a concluſion cannot fairly be drawn from thoſe premiſes, no more then if a man ſhould ſay from that in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19, 20. <hi>[The Holy Ghoſt is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own, for ye are bought with a price]</hi> that all that are bought with a price have the Holy Ghoſt in them, and ſo thoſe falſe Teachers in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. which bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction. That clauſe, <hi>For he bare their iniquities,</hi> ſhews the ground upon which by his knowledg he might (and (ſo) did) juſtifie them, that he proceeded legally, not the adequate object of his act of bearing ſins. Thence alſo he adds by his knowledg, that is, by making known his truth, or doctrine, or himſelf in it, he ſhall juſtifie many; how comes that about, that he by his knowledg ſhould produce ſuch an effect? the reaſon is rendred, for he bare their iniquities. He ſhall make known himſelf to them, as one able to ſave them, and ſo draw them in to him, and then by vertue of his ſufferings for them he ſhall juſtifie them, for that was it by which he was perfected for confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſuch a favor on them that obey him, as in <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. He ſaith not, he juſtifies many by bearing their ſins, as if that alone did it, but by his knowledg, which knowledg, whoſo regard not, nor receive, they go without that juſtification, or accounting righteous, there ſpoken of, yea though he dyed for them (and had they received that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of him, both could and would have juſtified them) men ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling at him, and not believing on him, may periſh, though Chriſt have dyed for them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.11.</p>
                  <p>Again, his inference from that in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.5. [<hi>By his ſtripes we are healed,</hi> Therefore <hi>All that he dyed for</hi>] hath no more force, then if ſome <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that were healed by looking to the brazen
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:117749:57"/>Serpent ſhould ſay, By the brazen Serpent we are healed, Therefore All that it was ſet up for were healed by it. Of no more force are thoſe other inferences from <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32, 33. He that ſpared not his Son, but gave him up to the Death for us All, how ſhall he not with him give us all things? <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s,</hi> that are in Chriſt Jeſus, that walk after the ſpirit, that have received the firſt fruits of it, that are called, juſtified, &amp;c. Its like the confident reaſoning of the believing <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites, Exod.</hi> 13.13, 14, 16, 17. God that brought us out of Egypt by ſo mighty a hand, redeeming us, and bringing us forth in his mercy. will guide us by his ſtrength to his holy habitation,
<note place="margin">Numb. 14.9, 10.</note> bring us in, and plant us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that is, ſuch as in this confidence follow his conduct, and rebel not againſt him. Now as if one from thence ſhould infer, <hi>Ergo</hi> all that he brought out of Egypt he ſurely brought into Canaan: juſt ſuch are thoſe three inferences of Mr. <hi>Owens</hi> from that <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>viz.</hi> 
                     <q>That all he gave Chriſt for, 1. He gives to believe in him, (that is compels them to believe) And 2. Brings them to glory, (an inference wholly groundleſs from that Text, that ſpeaking of actual believers, and not of faith, as a thing yet to be given them) and All that he dyed for. 3. He makes interceſſion for (for the collating all the choiſe benefits of his Death upon) (for thats the meaning of his third inference, though not ſo <hi>in terminis</hi> expreſſed, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe I ſhould not deny it) but I have ſaid enough before to theſe kinde of inferences, and I ſhall ſpeak fullier to that place where he more fully urges it, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>chap.</hi> 11.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which follows in him hath ſomething in it worthy the noting, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe Aſſertions repeated and ſpoken to by him. As,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <q>In that he denies Gods inclination to do us good to be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and neceſſary,</q> he croſſes that common maxime, <hi>Quicquid in Deo eſt, Deus eſt,</hi> every thing in God, is God: and if that be true, then its neceſſary and natural to God, for that which is God cannot but be, and ſo whatever love is in him to us, muſt be neceſſary, it being ſomething in him. Beſides the Scripture defines him by love. God is love, which ſure hath in it an inclination to do good, and what he is, is natural to him, and as neceſſary as he; though what object to act forth his love toward, and in what way, is not neceſſary but meerly free to him; and therefore when he ſays that every thing acted by him towards us is an act of his free-will, <hi>opponit non opponenda,</hi> ſeeing though his actings be voluntary, yet his nature is eſſentiall and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and theſe two croſs not each other.</p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:117749:57"/>
                  <p>
                     <q>Whereas he ſaith, the aſcribing an Antecedent will to God, whoſe fulfilling depends on any free contingent act of ours, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to God.</q> This falls not upon us. But I conceive that that may be called an Antecedent VVill of God, which reſpects ſome Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent condition in us, in reſpect of ſome VVill of God, reſpecting us as its proper object in a conſequent condition. As (to explain my meaning.) God viewing <hi>Adam</hi> as innocent, willed him Paradiſe, and fellowſhip with himſelf (yet the injoyment of this to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his ſtanding in that created condition) but viewing him as voluntarily faln, he willed to expel him from Paradiſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the former of theſe in reſpect of the latter, may be called Antecedent, as it was a Will reſpecting an Antecedent, or former condition of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the latter a conſequent will to that fall from his former condition beheld by him. So a Will to provide a Saviour for men as helpleſs and faln, and to extend goodneſs to them through him, compared with his Will to exclude them his Kingdom, and ſeal them up under wrath, as obſtinately, after light and power vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed, rebelling againſt his Son, and abuſing his goodneſs, may be called an Antecedent will, and the latter a Conſequent, though that denomination of Antecedent and Conſequent ariſes rather from the priority and poſteriority in the objects, then the will it ſelf. For that place, <hi>Who hath reſiſted his will?</hi> as it makes nothing againſt what I have here ſaid, ſo I ſhall ſay nothing to it here, but refer what I have to ſay about it to my Anſwer to <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. where he urges it again, as alſo his third Aſſertion, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. That a meer common Affection and Inclination to do good to all, ſets not out the freedom, fulneſs, and dimenſions of the Love of God aſſerted in Scripture, as the cauſe of ſending Chriſt. To my Anſwer to his fourth Book, and ſecond Chapter, where he further urges it again.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <q>4. Whereas he denies, that all mankinde was the object of that love of God that moved him to ſend Chriſt.</q> We believe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies it; but how doth he diſprove it? why thus.

If Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> think that them that are now wicked, God made them at firſt for the day of deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and therefore left them to be wicked, (for I hope he thinks not that God made any wicked) then he muſt ſay his creating work was to moſt an act of hatred, and that God hated men, while inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and righteous, and while his own meer workmanſhip, for in that inſtant he intimates that he made them unto wrath, which ſuits not with the Nature of God, which is Love, nor with the Truth of God, that ſaith, That God loves the righteous, as all were when God created them.

Some that Chriſt dyed to purchaſe all into his diſpoſe, but yet bare not any ſin of theirs, nor did ranſom them from any foregoing ſentence upon them. Some that he hath not bought them or dyed for them at all, onely ſeemed to buy them; others that he dyed to buy many good things for them, but not to buy them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but to what purpoſe doth he repeat (or I recriminate) ſuch things, which ſhew but that we have not attained to unity of faith in perfection, or that there are imperfections in our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of truth? not that this, or that is the truth. I doubt not but <hi>Veritas magna eſt, &amp; praevalebit:</hi> As truth ſhines forth more brightly, ſo the many oppoſitions againſt it by them, and the many ſwarvings from it in ſome conceptions that may be amongſt us, will all vaniſh and be ſcatterred, nor ſhall its abettors need ſuch diſtinctions as are not founded in the Scriptures, nor ſuch expreſſions as there finde no footing, as many of Mr. <hi>Owens</hi> are, as we ſhall ſee; as what he gives us as the ſumm of the truth in this matter, <hi>viz.</hi>

                        <hi>That god out of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite love to his Elect ſent his dear Son in the fulneſs of time, to dy and pay a ranſome of infinite value and dignity for the purchaſing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal redemption, and bringing unto himſelf all and every one of thoſe whom he had before ordained to eternal life for the praiſe of his grace.</hi>

Our Saviour himſelf expreſſed not himſelf ſo. He ſaith not, God ſo loved his Elect that he gave his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son, that every one that believes ſhould not periſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but God ſo loved the World: Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> confounds the Elect and the World together, and makes as if Chriſt had ſaid, that every one of the Elect that believes ſhould not periſh. Beſides, I would have Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſhew me that any perſons were conſidered as
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:117749:60"/>Elect before the conſideration of Chriſts dying for men, and how they are ſaid then to be Elect in Chriſt, and not in <hi>Adam</hi> rather; if men looked upon either as in <hi>Maſſâ purâ,</hi> or as <hi>in Maſſâ corruptâ,</hi> were the object of Election, and not rather as Chriſt was eyed intervening between God and them.</p>
                  <p>What he ſays about the value and dignity of the ranſom, and price which Chriſt paid, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                     <q>That it was infinite and fit for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing of any end, and procuring any good for all and every one for whom it was intended,</q> had they been millions of men more then ever were created, we ſhall meet with it again in <hi>li.</hi> 4. <hi>ca.</hi> 1. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhal onely ſay this to it here, That it fairly intimates, that Chriſt hath merited more by it then ever ſhalbe applyed, the deſert or merit of it being immeaſurable for extent, but the application of it bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo if ſtrictly looked into, he grants ſuch difference between the meriting of it and its application, as he faults his adverſaries for; nay and makes a great, yea an infinite part of its merit to be to no purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>His following Aſſertions are things again and again affirmed, but never as yet proved by Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                     <q>Either that the whole adae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate intention of God in giving Chriſt, was the bringing many ſons to glory,</q> or, that all the things procured by Chriſts death are to be beſtowed on All that Chriſt dyed for. I conceive my expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions laid down in the beginning of this Chapter, are cleerer, and leſs cloudy, yea and more conſonant to the Scripture expreſſions, then what he hath given us as the Sum of the Truth in this buſineſs.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. <q>Its contrary to reaſon that the Death of Chriſt in Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention ſhould be applyed to any one that ſhall have no ſhare in the merits of that Death.</q> None of all his adverſaries produced by him ſay any ſuch thing, they rather deny the application of it to many, then ſay that ſome to whom its <hi>to be</hi> applyed, have no ſhare in his merits. "Whereas he ſays many know not of it; we have ſhewed before that a man may have a fruit of love from another that he knows not. <hi>Cyrus</hi> was girded and ſtrengthned by God, though he knew him not. So men have a releaſe from the dealing of God with them according to the merit of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, which ſhould elſe unavoidably have come upon them, and this by Chriſt though many know not him; And all receive ſome fruits of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, though many knew not that there was ſuch a one, or what his ſin was. <q>Whereas he ſaith, its againſt reaſon, that a ranſom ſhould be paid for captives upon compact of deliverance, and yet upon payment thoſe captives not be made free and ſet at liberty; that Chriſt ſhould be a ranſom upon compact of deliverance of captives, and yet the greateſt number of them never be releaſed.</q> That is falſly bottomed, for God releaſed All from that deadly deſtroying ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, which hath God taken the forfeit of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin in that very day, had ruined <hi>Adam</hi> and his whole poſterity. Juſtification of life
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:117749:62"/>is to all, ſo that they All have life here, and ſhall (however) be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed and brought out of the death that is ordered to them by occaſion of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, in the reſurrection, ſo far are all acquitted that if any periſh its not in that but in a ſecond Death. Yea all are releaſed alſo in this regard, that whereas all were caſt out of Gods preſence, and might not approach to him, now through Chriſt all have free leave to approach to him, all are commanded to repent and turn to him, to look to him and be ſaved, whoever will may come and welcome; yea God is ſo far from keeping them away, that he faults men for not coming to him, <hi>John</hi> 5.40. Now if a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom be paid for captives, and the priſon doors opened, and means afforded for leading them out, and priſoners willingly and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornly refuſe, but will ſtay in priſon ſtill (as in this later reſpect many do) ſhall that be imputed as a defect of juſtice in him to whom the ranſom was paid for them? Surely no, except it could be proved that that was the compact, that he ſhould in that regard compel, and forcibly cauſe to come out of priſon, all that the ranſom was paid for; which I am ſure Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> will not be able to prove in this matter. Chriſt no where ſays to any, God would not have you come to him, you are not included in the ranſom, nor that all that he dyed for ſhall be brought in to him; but he often tels us, God would have them ſeek him and come to him, and faults them that they will not.</p>
                  <p>"For that after-ſhift (as he cals it) of conditional and abſolute obtaining of things; it fals not upon me. I affirm that liberty from that firſt ſentence's execution upon us was abſolutely obtained, Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of life to All. And that liberty is opened in the Goſpel to All and men exhorted to enter, and for not ſtriving to enter now, the door comes to be ſhut upon many (that which they have ſhall be taken from them, becauſe they liked to have it) and then they cannot enter. Alſo that all life, remiſſion, and fulneſs, are abſolutely put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſts hands, only I ſay the will of God for his diſpenſation, and ſo to his propoſition of the things to be diſpenſed (not his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining them into his diſpoſe, nor the freeneſs, and openneſs of them for men to look after and come to him for them) hath a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion annexed. God wils Chriſt to diſpenſe them to men upon coming to him, and Chriſt holds them forth upon that condition to any, Whoever will, let him come, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we deny that Chriſt is bound to make known to all for whom he dyed, the fulneſs that is in him like evidently, or himſelf or the way of ſalvation to all alike expreſly,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:117749:62"/>or expreſly at all. That all are bound to minde and imbrace what he revealeth to them, is clear, but that he is bound to make known this or that to all he dyed for, I deny that Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> can any where prove. He may bring infants to himſelf, and diſpenſe his ſalvation to them, and yet never give them capacity to hear the condition of ſalvation; and yet we believe what the Scripture ſaith,
<note place="margin">John 1.9.</note> that he is the true light that inlightens every man coming into the world. He is not bound to give every man ten talents alike, open and plain decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of himſelf and Father (no not for ſaving them) but every man is bound to improve and ſubmit to God in what he gives them, be it more or leſs; and if they do ſo, he is able and ready to give more (being liberal and free) and can tell how to ſave them: if not, he is juſt to take away what they have, and not bound to ſave them, He being Lord of them. Nor yet ſay we that men have power of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to improve what is given them, but he who gives them the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, gives them the power too, in which he requires them to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them, and its not inability, but ſlothfulneſs and obſtinacy for which they are faulted and condemned by him, becauſe they rather chuſe to live idly in themſelves, and dy, then ſtir abroad to ſeek God,

Chriſt, as he is the Truth of God, is the great Phyſitian of ſouls, and by revelations of truth both cals to himſelf for healing, and by further revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it to thoſe that come to him, doth heal.
<note place="margin">John 14.6.</note> The truth ſhall make you free, and this becauſe He hath given himſelf a ranſom for them in the firſt place (without which neither ground of calling, nor fitneſs to heal them) Now this Great Truth of God doth ſend abroad his beams of divine light, and ſo ſome ſparklings of himſelf as the Word of God and God, by vertue of his relation to the humane nature (firſt virtually and then actually united to him) to men in generall;
<note place="margin">John 1 4, 5, 9,</note> though not ſo clearly nor ſo many beams at all times as in ſome, nor to All men as to ſome. Yet to the generality ſome Beams of truth,
<note place="margin">Rom. 1.18, 19, 21.28. Acts 17 27, &amp; 28.27. Job 21.14</note> &amp; thoſe beams have their force in their leading them to know ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of God, &amp; ſo to ſeek him groping after him if happily they may finde him; yea ſuch power as that men are fain to ſuppreſs and keep them under, and bid them be gone, and ſhut their eyes againſt them, leſt they work too much upon them. Now though they ſee not what a one, or who he it whence theſe beams come, and thoſe opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in their hearts, yet they knowing in their conſciences that they ought to obey them, and that it would be better for them ſo to do

So that <q>Mr. <hi>Owens</hi> compariſon of Chriſt to a phyſitian tendring cure,</q> &amp; he wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,
<note place="margin">Rom. 1.20.28.</note> is a miſtake alſo, nor ſhall men be able to make good that plea when he comes to judge them; though many ſhall ſay in reſpect of his perſon and fuller appearances, when ſaw we thee thus and thus? as if they would plead ignorance of him, yet he ſhall take away that plea from them, making it appear that in ſuch and ſuch <hi>mediums</hi> (as his poor people),
<note place="margin">Matth. 25.42, 43, 44, 55.</note> he was evidencing himſelf to them, and preſenting himſelf before them, and there they would not know him. <q>Nor is he as one tendring a thouſand pound to a blinde man on conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he will ſee, and yet giving no ability to ſee:</q> but he in tendring gives forth ſuch light that men ſee ſome glimmerings, and bids them look though but with their blinde holes that they may ſee; which did they, the light would make them ſee and ſee more clearly, yea it would turn them,

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:117749:63"/>the Death of Chriſt: none of them had been afforded to us, had not Chriſt dyed for us.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Its the promiſe of God to Chriſt, ſo to exalt and glorifie him, that ſome ſhould be brought in to him and be given him to believe, and be his ſeed.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Yea its by the diſcovery of Gods good-will in the death and reſurrection of Chriſt, that God uſeth to overcome men to believe, and ſo his blood and death, as ſo diſcovered and ſet home, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deems men out of their bondage to Sathan, and world, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9, 10, &amp; 14.4.</p>
                  <p>But that Chriſt obliged the Father to make all thoſe men that he dyed for, to walk out in the exerciſe of ſuch power and liberty of acting, as he ſhould in his gracious diſpenſations afford them, for attendance to means, receit of light given, looking up to him in that light, yea to believe in him and rely on him for ſalvation, this I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him to prove. Its not proveable by Scripture ſo far as I can finde, nay I may uſe this argument againſt it (bottomed upon Mr. <hi>Owens</hi> own maxime) <hi>viz.</hi> Whatever Chriſt procured or merited by his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that he intercedes to have collated or beſtowed on men: But Scripture no where ſhews that Chriſt intercedes for faith (ſaving faith) to be given to one or other, <hi>Ergo</hi> Scripture no where proves that he procured that by his oblation. The major is Mr. <hi>Owens</hi> own in <hi>cap.</hi> 4.6. &amp; 7. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. The minor is eaſily proved by Inducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, no one place ſpeaking of Chriſts Interceſſion mentions his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceding for ſaving faith; not that platform (as ſome ſay) of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion, in <hi>John</hi> 17. as we ſhewed <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>chap.</hi> 2. if not there, no where elſe, for in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33. he mentions his interceding for <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s,</hi> men in Chriſt, believers, but ſays not for what, much leſs for faith, that they had already. In <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. Its for thoſe that come unto God by him, that ſome might come to God by him. I leave it for him to finde any one place in which Chriſt prays that God would make any to believe. Nor will this diminiſh at all the honor and love due to him, for as <q>Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſays, We are not to invent ways of honoring him, but give him that that in the Scripture God gives to him.</q> He produces <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5, 6, &amp; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. but neither of them ſay that Chriſt procured faith for us, as obliging God to give it us; the former ſhews but how God wrought it in diſcovering his love, and the latter, that Chriſt became ſin for us; that we might in him (that is in believing in him) be made the righteouſneſs of God; and ſo that he
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:117749:64"/>opened the way for our believing and making righteous, not that he obliged God to make us, or all that he dyed for, righteouſly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; no more then in <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. where He ſays he dyed for all, that they that live might not henceforth live to themſelves, he ſhews that therefore he obliged God to make all ceaſe from thenceforth to live to themſelves, and God performs not his obligation to him, in that ſo many, even after believing, live ſo much to themſelves, and minde their own things, as <hi>Paul</hi> complaineth. That he ſhall bring in a ſeed to him, I grant, but that he is obliged to bring in this or that Individual to be of that ſeed, muchleſs all that he dyed for, I no where finde. That in <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3. &amp; <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.29. We ſhall meet with afterward, and with the point it ſelf alſo more fully urged, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. where we ſhall ſpeak to them; only this I ſhall ſay to them here, that neither of them ſay, that Chriſt by his death ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged the Father to give to this or that, muchleſs to all he dyed for, effectually to believe in him and to be ſaved, not a word to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. So that that piece of doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> That for whom Chriſt dyed, them he procured faith for, is none of thoſe Scripture-truths that will ſcatter the ſuppoſed clouds and miſts. Nor yet follows it, that the whole impetration of Redemption is made unprofitable. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God hath ingaged himſelf ſo to glorifie his Son, that ſome ſhall be brought in, though he no were ſay All he dyed for, nor (that I know of) any particular perſons, ſo as that this or that individuall muſt, or elſe he ſhould be unjuſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He ſhall have much glory from his good, bounteous, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful diſpenſations to men through the Death of Chriſt, that yet he compels not to believe on Chriſt;
<note place="margin">Matt. 22.2, 3, 4, 5. with Rom. 11.36.</note> yea in the juſt and righteous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of thoſe that ſin'd againſt that mercy, and refuſed to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to him. <q>For that condition upon which he ſuppoſes we will ſay Chriſt is to beſtow ſalvation, <hi>viz.</hi> ſo they do not refuſe or reſiſt the means of grace;</q> Its a miſtake, we know no ſuch impoſition put upon him, for men may receive the means, and yet rebel againſt the grace it ſelf that comes in them, have a form and deny the power of godlineſs, and for that periſh; <q>Though that all Pagans and infidels are left deſtitute of all means leading them to ſeek after God, or that any that have no outward means from Chriſt, nor ever reſiſt Gods workings in them, ſhall be condemned, as Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> would perſwade us, I leave for him to prove.</q> Chriſt ſays to the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:117749:64"/>Jews, that if he had not come and ſpoken to them, they had not had ſin; and for ought I know, If Chriſt neither come in Word,
<note place="margin">Joh. 15.22</note> nor in any ſpiritual way (as he preached to the old world by his Spirit) if any ſuch he can finde, they may not have ſin charged on them to condemnation, and deſtruction. Yet if Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> can ſhew me o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, I will believe it. For making Chriſt but a half Mediator, its frivolous, yet we ſhall ſpeak to it, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 3. where it occurs again. That Chriſt did not dye for any on condition of their believing, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; nor that he dyed only for the Elect of God, that they ſhould believe, nor finde I any Scripture calling any man while yet in and of the world, an Elect perſon. He dyed for All, that being Lord of them, and preſenting his light to them according to the good pleaſure of the Father, whoſoever believes might not periſh, but have eternal life.

<label type="milestone">

                  </p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Rom the nature of the Covenant of Grace, eſtabliſhed, ratified, and confirmed in and by the Death of Chriſt. His Argument runs thus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The effects of the death of Chriſt cannot be extended beyond the compaſs of the new Covenant (or Chriſt died only for thoſe that are within the New Covenant) But this Covenant was not made univerſally with all, but particularly onely with ſome.</q> Therefore thoſe alone were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in the benefits of the death of Chriſt. A very vitious Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereof the Concluſion contains <hi>a quartus terminus,</hi> for in ſtead of any <hi>effects,</hi> the tearm propounded in the <hi>Major,</hi> He ſays the <hi>benefits</hi> therein (as is clear by what follows in him) comprehending the choice benefits of the death of Chriſt applied. The <hi>Major</hi> alſo is
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:117749:65"/>ambiguous and uncertain. For either it is univerſal, as No effect of the death of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or elſe particular, as Some do not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If the latter, its impertinent, and concludes not againſt the death of Chriſt for All, but onely its having ſome effects in All, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the thing in queſtion; if the former, as I ſuppoſe he intends it, then I deny it. I deny, I ſay, that Chriſt died for none (or that none have any effect of his death extended to them) but onely ſuch as with whom the New Teſtament is made. He brings no other proof for it (which he perhaps therefore liſped in, becauſe he ſaw himſelf weak in the proof of it) but onely from that title given to his blood, that its called <hi>The blood of the New Teſtament.</hi> So that his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove that, runs thus. <hi>Its called the blood of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> Therefore ſhed onely for them, that are heirs of the New Teſtament. Which is like this, The Spirit is called the <hi>Spirit of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and the Comforter,</hi> Therefore whoever it works upon, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts them; and ſo when it convinces the world of ſin, its their comforter too, and when it kindles the fire of <hi>Tophet, Iſai.</hi> 30.33. it comforts them that are tormented with it. A wilde Argument! and yet ſuch is his. The truth is, As its an office of the Spirit to comfort, and he is a Comforter to all that obey him; ſo is it an office of the blood of Chriſt, or rather one end of its ſhedding, to ratifie the new Covenant, which it alſo doth to all that believe in it: But as that is not all the work, or buſineſs of the Spirit, to comfort, ſo neither was that all the work or end of the blood of Chriſt to eſtabliſh the new Covenant; but firſt of all to ranſom from the death that was paſſed upon men; and then to confirm a Covenant to the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> This blood where ever its tendered, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is tendred with it; <hi>Hear and your ſouls ſhall live, and I will make an everlaſting Covenant with you, the ſure mercies of</hi> David, and he that obeys this, is entred into Covenant by it; but not All for whom it was ſhed, are in Covenant by its ſhedding; no more then all for whom the water of Purification was made, were therefore purified, becauſe it was made for them, and called the water of Purification, <hi>Numb.</hi> 19 9.20.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> alſo miſtakes the parties with whom the Covenant is made. For he underſtands them to be a certain number of perſons yet lying in the world, and that its one clauſe of the Covenant to give them faith, or make them to believe; whereas indeed (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as pertaining to the <hi>Gentiles</hi>) the proper object with whom
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:117749:66"/>the Covenant is made, is the called of God, believers in Chriſt Jeſus, into thoſe mens hearts God will put his fear (not to bring them to him, but) to keep them from departing from him (which argues their being brought to him before) theſe ſhall have the Law written in their hearts; an alluſion to the old Teſtament written in Tables of Stone, not before they were brought out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but after they were Baptized into <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Cloud, and in the Sea, and were come to Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> The Apoſtle alluding to that, tells the believing <hi>Hebrews,</hi> partakers of the heavenly Call (<hi>Heb.</hi> 3.1.) that they were not come to Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> to have a Law of works and death put upon them, but to Mount <hi>Sion</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Whence the Law of Grace go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth. Iſai. 2.3.</note> to hear him that ſpeaks from heaven (and ſo intimately to have the Law writ in their hearts) <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.18, 22, 24, 25. in which they came alſo to the blood of ſprinkling. He doth not ſay, they were come to Mount <hi>Sion</hi> while they were yet uncalled, but in obeying the Call, they came thither to meet with, and receive the new Covenant oppoſed to the Covenant made with their Fathers at Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> That that confirms me in this belief, is this, that it is by faith that we are made of one body with the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, and are no where called the ſeed of <hi>Promiſe,</hi> or <hi>Iſrael of God,</hi> till brought to Chriſt: but then we are all one with the believing <hi>Jews, Jews</hi> in the inner man, the Circumciſion, the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and heirs according to <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, Gal.</hi> 3.26. 29. Now the Covenant ſpoken of, is made with the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah.</hi> If Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> think men to be <hi>faede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates</hi> in that Covenant before faith, let him ſhew me that any unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>Gentiles</hi> or uncalled, are called by the name of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides, That the promiſes of God are made with Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. and are in him, <hi>yea, and Amen,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. But if any yet out of Chriſt, ſhould be <hi>faederates</hi> while out of him, then they ſhould have a larger object then Chriſt, and a larger performance then in Chriſt Jeſus. But I ſay this, <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> to the <hi>Minor,</hi> it being ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to the overthrow of the Argument, that the <hi>Major</hi> is proofleſs. <q>Whereas Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> makes the difference between the Old and New Teſtament to be, That this Covenants the giving of Faith,</q> and that not, I deny it, and ſay, The difference between them is in this, That was carnal, weak, and afforded not ſuch operation of Spirit; This ſpiritual, powerful, and full of life, writing Gods teachings in the heart, whereas that writ them but without in Books or Tables
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:117749:66"/>of Stones. That propounded Precepts and Promiſes, but gave not the performance; This in Teaching conforms the heart to Gods VVill, and gives in the injoyment, and accompliſhment of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; whence, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The righteouſneſs of the Law is fulfilled in us that walk not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit, Rom.</hi> 8.4. That this Covenant is propounded conditionally too, to thoſe that are not yet believers, we have ſhewed before in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55.3. So that no man ſhort of believing can ſay (as Mr. <hi>Owens</hi> Objection ſuppoſeth;) The Lord hath promiſed <hi>To write his Law in our hearts,</hi> but if we liſten to Chriſt, he will write them in our hearts; but to the believer in Chriſt, to him that is Chriſts, the Covenant is free, he being the proper heir of it, as is before ſhewed. He repeates his Argument again in the winding up of the Argument. <q>That the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, was the blood of the Covenant, and his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation was intended onely for procuring the things intended and promiſed thereby, and therefore it cannot have reſpect to All, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> That it procured the good things contained in the Covenant, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that he ingages the performance of them to the called (for I think the word (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>ſponſor</hi>) hath rather that ſignification then of a <hi>procurer</hi>) we grant, and to that the Quotation of <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. is pertinent, but his inference from thence is yet unproved, as we have ſhewed. And ſo we have ſeen the fallacy and weakneſs of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. His ſecond Argument is thus. <q>
                        <hi>That if the Lord intended,
<label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Argu. </seg>2</label> that he ſhould</hi> (and ſo Chriſt by his death did) <hi>procure pardon of ſin, and reconciliation with God, for all and every one, to be actually injoyed upon condition that they do believe, then ought this good will and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, with this purchaſe in their behalf by Jeſus Chriſt be made known to them by the Word, that they might believe,</hi> for faith comes by hearing, <hi>&amp;c. otherwiſe men may be ſaved without faith in, and the knowledg of Chriſt, or elſe the purchaſe is plainly in vain; but all men have not thoſe things declared to them, in and by the Word,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this Argument many things may be anſwered,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>

                  <p n="1">1.

                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:117749:67"/>
                  <p n="2">2. Again, The Antecedent of the <hi>Major</hi> contains, and crowds together divers queſtions, which is another fallacy in arguing. As with this, Of Chriſts dying for All, it jumbles Gods intention of his procuring Reconciliation and Pardon, and the intention of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing it, and upon what condition. Now theſe are three diſtinct queſtions, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, Whether Chriſt died for All? The thing he ſet himſelf to oppoſe. Secondly, Whether in dying for them he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured Reconciliation, and forgiveneſs for all? And Thirdly, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he procured it for All, with intention that they all ſhould injoy it upon condition of believing? The firſt of theſe, I abſolutely affirm, and Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> denies. The ſecond, I thus affirm, That for the offence of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the condemnation that came upon All therefore, he hath procured juſtification or pardon for All; ſo as that God dealeth with All after another manner, then according to its Merit, and the Obligation to Death that came thereby. And for their other ſins, there is with him a treaſury of Forgiveneſs and Redemption, full and free for All. So as that (in anſwer to the third) All may have forgiveneſs of all their ſins, and Reconciliation upon believing in him; and it was his intention, that whoſoever of All (yea, were it All) believe in him, ſhould have forgiveneſs of ſins, and be reconciled to God by him. Whence its propounded to men in general upon that condition in the Goſpel. But yet, neither is that condition upon which God propounds it, to be confounded (as Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> here doth) with the act of purchaſing it, and Gods intention therein; nor may we binde up God to that condition in his diſpenſing it, nor his intention of forgiving and ſaving men, in his giving Chriſt to dye for them: as if becauſe All, or Any may have it (according to the Goſpel-tender) upon believing, therefore he intended that none ſhould have it that have not that believing condition. For I dare not ſay, That God intended not that any Infant dying in its Cradle, or deaf man that never heard any word at all, ſhould have forgiveneſs or ſalvation by vertue of Chriſts purchaſe, becauſe they have not that act of believing that comes by hearing; whence alſo,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I deny the conſequence of the major propoſition, if by <hi>[ought to made known]</hi> he means (as I ſuppoſe he doth) that God ought or is bound ſo to have done (for that word <hi>[ought]</hi> may be otherwiſe applyed as we ſhall ſee anon) for though its true that whoſoever by hearing the word believes, ſhall have remiſſion, yet God nor tying
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:117749:67"/>himſelf in his diſpenſation thereof to that condition (for them to dy in infancy, and to be born and continue deaf to death, ſhould be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary evidences of reprobation, which I think none is ſo hardy as to affirm) it will follow that God is not bound to that making known to every one the purchaſe and intention ſpoken of, leſt he ſhould be fruſtrate of his intention. Beſides that a man may poſſibly be brought to believe and receive forgiveneſs, that never heard of that purchaſe and intention, and yet their Faith may come by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too, a man may be brought to believe that God is, &amp; is a reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of them that ſeek him (which is as much as the Apoſtle ſays is of neceſſity for coming to him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6.) yea many have believed ſo much that have not known of Chriſts death, or that he ſhould dy, muchleſs of the purchaſe and intention of God in his death. As the Diſciples had faith, and ſo had <hi>Cornelius</hi> too, ſuch as in which they were accepted of God before they underſtood that Chriſt ſhould dye, and by dying purchaſe them forgiveneſs and reconciliation, and doubtleſs many of the Ancients heard leſs then they of him, as <hi>Rahab, Ruth, Naaman.</hi> and many others, ſo that at leaſt a making known to all (for ſo he intends) ſo much as he ſpeaks of, would not neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appertain to God, though the Antecedent were granted in the very form in which he puts it. Indeed God binds us to preach and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare in theſe laſt dayes ſince the aſcenſion of Chriſt, this his purchaſe and intention, and men are bound to give credit to it when preached, that ſo they might the better be brought to him, and they that keep back that doctrine from men, if they periſh, are guilty of their blood: but God hath not by any thing he hath done, or by his intention there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, bound himſelf to make known to every, one for whom he hath ſo done, that his intention &amp; doing. A Prince may ranſom from deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Nation appoitned thereto for ſome default againſt their Sover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aign, with intention that every one that obeys his counſels ſhall injoy the priviledges of free ſubjects, and ſo that they all ſhall have ſuch pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges ſo obeying, &amp; yet that may put no ingagement upon him, to cauſe every particular of them to know what he hath done for them, &amp; what was his intention therein, eſpecially too they never knowing diſtinctly how they came to be lyable to their ruine from which he ranſomed them; only he may propound (though at a diſtance from them, and as to perſons unknown to them) ſome advices and counſels, in obeying which he may do to them as he intended, and in diſobeying them fruſtrate them of the otherwiſe intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:117749:68"/>benefits; yea and order puniſhment alſo to them without any abſurdity or croſneſs to his intention.</p>

The words <hi>[ought to be made known]</hi> may ſignifie, It ought to be made known by men, ſuch as are the meſſengers of Chriſt and preachers of the word, and then indeed we grant it to be a truth, that All ought to have it made known to them by us to the utmoſt of our opportunities and abilities; and ſo it reproves Mr. <hi>Owen,</hi> and many other Miniſters for their faultineſs herein, becauſe they not only make not known to All without reſtrictions this good will and purchaſe of Chriſt for them, but they on the contrary make it uncertain to men whether Chriſt dyed for them or not, yea hinder and oppoſe the making known this good will to All men; I would they would ceaſe to do what they ought not, and do as they ought.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But then, The minor of this Argument is faulty and containes a <hi>Quartus terminus,</hi> for whereas he ſhould have aſſumed thus, But this purchaſe, good will and intention, ought not to be made known to All, he hath aſſumed thus, All have not theſe things made known to them in and by the word: But who ſees not that between what men have, and what they ought to have, there is a great difference? God may have done what appertains to him, not only in giving to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> the knowledg of his truth, though leſs clearly, that it might be propagated by one to another ſuceſſively in all their generations, but alſo and that more clearly, in giving it forth to his ſervants to be made known to All Nations for the obedience of faith, willing all to come to the knowledg of it, as indeed he hath done <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.25, 26. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. and yet thoſe to whom this charge of divulging it appertains, being ſlothful and negligent here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and others not coming to it, when, and as held forth to them, as in many divulgers and others is too true, they may not have what they ought to have, and might have had, had the will of God afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid been obeyed by them. So that this argument the further we look into it, the leſs hurt it doth us; But I ſhall ſay no more to it, leſt I be too tedious: many paſſages he hath about it, are but the ſame with what we had <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap. ult.</hi> where I have anſwered them, and ſhall not need here again further to repeat. Only whereas he ſaith, <q>
                        <hi>The Spirit forbad the Apoſtles to go to ſundry places with the word,</hi> as if God would not have ſome hear of his word,</q> though they might have had it: the places he aims at are, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.6, 7. where
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:117749:68"/>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> aſſaying to go to <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Bithinia,</hi> were forbidden; this is to be noted, that that was not becauſe he would not have the Goſpel preached to them, but becauſe the Apoſtle not being able to go two ways at once, and there being others whom God pleaſed to prefer, ſent them elſewhere firſt, ordering others to preach at thoſe places, or the ſame to preach there when the other work was over: therefore the Holy Ghoſt as if he would give us an account of this action, to prevent our raſh miſpriſions particularly names theſe places to have been peculiarly preached to; As concerning <hi>Aſia</hi> we have a fuller teſtimony then of any other place, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.10. All that dwelt in <hi>Aſia</hi> heard the word of the Lord; and for <hi>Bithinia,</hi> there were many believing people ſcattered abroad in it, as appears in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1. who were to ſhine as lights, and ſhew forth the praiſes of him that called them in the places where they lived.</p>
                  <p>Again, whereas in the concluſion of this Argument he ſaith, <q>
                        <hi>That</hi> Paul <hi>tels us that by the works of creation they might be led to know his eternal power and Godhead: but that they ſhould know any thing of a Redemption and a Redeemer, was utterly impoſſible.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, firſt, That its not material. If Chriſt interpoſing himſelf between them and the blow of juſtice, preſerved and reſcued them from that, and then gave them no other hints of light and knowledg of God, but in his works, then he required the leſs of them again, for where leſs is given leſs is looked for again; he looked but that they ſhould feel after him ſo diſcovered, and glorifie him with thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as they came to know him, as in <hi>Act.</hi> 17.27. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19, 21. come to him as believing that he is, and is a rewarder of them that ſeek him. And its for not anſwering that little that he faults &amp; condemns them; he not judging them according to that they had not, nor according to the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> that I can finde, but according to their impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, abuſing and not liking to retain and yield to what they had, as is plain, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18, 19, 20, 21, 28. And its all one to give leſs and look for leſs, as to give a great deal more, and look for more in point of Retributive juſtice: and then,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It was not impoſſible for them to come know a Redemption and a Redeemer, becauſe that God that was evidenced to them in the works of Creation and Providence, being glorified according to thoſe hints given, was able and ſufficient to have revealed the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, as he did reveal him to <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> and to many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. All the Scriptures cannot bring a ſoul to Sonſhip in Chriſt
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:117749:69"/>or cauſe it to apprehend the glory of Gods Grace, ſo as to transform it into his Image, by all a mans reading and ſearching into them, without God add his Spirit: is that a good excuſe for a man to ſlight the Scriptures? No, let men attend to God in his means afforded, and do what he wills them, and inables them to, and leave the ſucceſs to God; if he cannot ſhew men by his Spirit, that that the means cannot without it, then the caſe is altered; but being he can do what he will, they are guilty of depriving themſelves of greater mercies, that bury their talent in the earth, and improve not what they have given them in mercy. He that is unfaithful in a little, would be ſo in greater things, and he cannot plead againſt God for the inſufficiency of thoſe means to reveal Chriſt, who yielded not to obey God in the means, who had all ſufficiency in himſelf beyond the means to do him good, and bring him to Chriſt.</p>

<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Argu. </seg>3</label> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>If Chriſt died for All that is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed and procured eternal redemption for All, then he either did it abſolutely or conditionally: but he did it neither abſolutely nor conditionally.</hi>
                     </q> To which I Anſwer, That he again jumbles together the purchaſe of Chriſt with his intention of beſtowing, and puts all this into the act of his dying for men, which is fallacious. We ſay, That Chriſt died as a ranſom for All, from what was upon them, as binding them over to deſtruction (previous to his coming) and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained eternal Redemption in himſelf of the Humane Nature from all thoſe miſeries that it was plunged into, with power of diſpenſing thereof to All or Any; and this purchaſe of it into himſelf was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, but the diſpenſing it is conditional, <hi>viz,</hi> upon their coming to him for it. There is no condition in his purchaſing any thing on our part, but there is condition in the propounding the things pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed. Now Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> confounds theſe together, and therein is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious, as in the former Chapter we have noted. As for Chriſts purchaſing faith, (that is, ingaging God to give it to this or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular) as we have ſaid ſomething to it, in <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. So the fuller ſpeaking to it, we reſerve to its proper place in <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap</hi> 4. The
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:117749:69"/>neceſſity of making known the condition upon which he is to diſpenſe life, we ſpake to in the former Chapter, as alſo of mens power in themſelves to perform it, we have formerly ſpoken to. I ſhall onely add this here, That if God gives men means of faith, and evidences to them that there they ought to ſeek him, and they put away thoſe means, they juſtly deprive themſelves of that divine ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural power for working faith on God and Chriſt, which, had they yieleed to the means, and to the light in them, he might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably have wrought. If <hi>Naaman</hi> refuſe to waſh in <hi>Jordan,</hi> which God gave him power to do, God may juſtly deny to heal him, nay, he deprives himſelf of that Almighty power that God was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to give forth in thoſe waters to heal him. And ſo, If the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> refuſed to look to the Braſen Serpent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such is the caſe here, Faith comes by hearing, and that is of the Word of God. Now if God give men his VVord, and opportunities of hearing it, and they either refuſe to hear, or when God gives them to diſcern ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in hearing, ſhut their eyes, and refuſe to look upon it, they are juſtly deprived of that faith, converſion, and healing, which would have followed. And that by ſuch doings men do often deprive themſelves of ſuch further favors that God would have beſtowed on them, is evident in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.11, 12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 48.17, 18. <hi>If they had hearkened to his voice, then he would have ſubdued their enemies, and their peace ſhould been as the rivers, and their righteouſneſs as the waves of the ſea,</hi> &amp;c. If men refuſe to do that that God gives them power to do, its juſt with God to withhold that that is the proper work of his power to do. So that the caſe here is not with men, as in ſuch compariſons as Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> makes of conditions impoſſible in themſelves, and in which they with whom they are poſſible will not help. For in this matter God both prevents with grace, and makes things poſſible, and requires obedience to that poſſibility, and is alſo ready to help, and promiſes to help in the day of that his grace, and therefore exhorts not to receive his grace in vain; onely he deals not with all in a compulſiſe or like powerful way. But as with <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the VVilderneſs, He was with them, and went before them, and would have led them ſafely to Reſt, and they followed Him, but refuſing to follow Him, as they might have done, He gave them over; So God, in his preventing Operations, doth give men power and liberty to means propounded, and is at hand to make thoſe impoſſibilities poſſible, and attainable; but men (as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>
                     <pb n="100" facs="tcp:117749:70"/>of old) ſay, the walls are high, and we cannot enter, and will not walk out in what God gives them, nor go in that way where they might experiment him, making rough ways plain, and hard things eaſie, and ſo they miſs of the experiments of his Divine Power that are needful for them, and then they fault Him for it. As the Proverb ſaith, <hi>The fooliſhneſs of a man perverts his way, and then his heart frets againſt the Lord, Prov.</hi> 19.2. And a ſluggard refuſes to put forth his ſtrength God gives him, and then ſaith, to colour over the matter, <hi>A Lyon is in the way.</hi> Juſt ſo is it here, men ſtifle, and refuſe to walk in what they have power and freedom from God to, and then they put it off with this, The buſineſs is too hard for them, and God gave them not grace to it. And truly Mr. <hi>Owen,</hi> and many other ſuch Preachers do frame ſuch excuſes to their mouths, telling them, <q>
                        <hi>That either God purpoſed to work faith in them or not, If not, its in vain for them to wait, nay, he would that they ſhould not believe: his not willing it, is a willing it ſhould not be. His calling upon them to believe, is but as if the King ſhould bid the Captives at</hi> Algiers <hi>free themſelves from their enemies, that they can in no wiſe do, and then he will pay a ranſom for them. If he did, then they muſt have it, they ſhall not need to take any care about it,</hi> &amp;c.</q> which paſſages as they contain notable falſities and diſſimilitudes, as may appear by what is already ſaid; ſo they ſerve to juſtifie the wicked in what ever they do, putting this plea into their mouths, even as high as the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> it ſelf, God willed not that it ſhould be otherwiſe, Therefore he would have it thus, and, God afforded no Grace for that he called for, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> contrary to his own ſayings, <hi>I would have gathered, and ye would not, yea I purged you, and ye were not purged,</hi> &amp;c. But I paſs it.</p>
                  <p>To that Poſition of ſome, <hi>That God beſtows faith on ſome, and not on others,</hi> He asks, <hi>Did Chriſt purchaſe that diſtinguiſhing love or not?</hi> To which I ſay, That if by love he means the Will of God, that ſome ſhould be effectually brought in rather then others (as he, with others, defines it to be <hi>Velle bonum creaturis</hi>) I do not ſee any ſuch thing held forth in Scriptures. I finde that Chriſt came to do Gods VVill towards men, not to purchaſe him to will more to theſe then thoſe men. If by Love he means the actings forth of his good-will upon men according to Gods purpoſe, then I ſay, by ſatisfying for, and removing the ſin that obſtructed, and ſtood between us and good things, he opened a way for God, according to his good will,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:117749:70"/>to beſtow things on men, and ſo may be ſaid to purchaſe their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing. Nor yet follows it (as Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> objects) <q>
                        <hi>That thoſe that are ſaved, have no more to thank Chriſt for, then thoſe that are damned, contrary to</hi> Rev. 1.5.</q> For thoſe that God peculiarly brings in to him, thoſe he taking as a ſpecial gift of him, waſhes in his blood (as in that Scripture mentioned) and ſo ſets them free, and actually brings them, or buyes them off from their pollutions, idols, bondages, and makes them clean, and ſo preſents them to his Father, as meet for his Fellowſhip and Delight, to them he gives his Spirit, imparts his Minde, gives them the priviledges and inheritance of ſons with himſelf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And is this nothing worth the believers thanking Chriſt for, more then they have that periſh? Though for the bringing to Chriſt, the Apoſtles manner is in eſpecial to give thanks to the Father, <hi>Giving thanks to the Father, who hath made us meet to partake of the inheritance of the Saints in light, who hath delivered us from the power of darkneſs, and tranſlated us into the Kingdom of his dear Son,</hi> Col. 1.13, 14. For Chriſts purchaſing faith, which Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> repeates over and over, in almoſt every Chapter, VVe ſhall meet with it more fully in <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. to which I refer it. And to conclude the Anſwer to the Argument, Chriſts dying conditionally, I diſclaim. His death was abſolutely undertaken, and undergone for All, but the life in him is on condition propounded in the Goſpel un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to All.</p>
                  <p>His fourth Argument is this.
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Argu. </seg>4</label> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>If God by his eternal purpoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed All men into two ſorts, and Chriſt is peculiarly affirmed to die for one of thoſe ſorts, and no where for them of the other, then he did not die for All. But God hath ſo diſtinguiſhed All men into two ſorts, Loved and Hated, Elect and Reprobate, Church and World,</hi> &amp;c. and ſaith, <hi>he died for the one, but never for the other,</hi> Ergo. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Both theſe Propoſitions are weak and erronious,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> therefore the Concluſion is neceſſarily erronious too. For firſt, He is not able to prove the Conſequence of the <hi>Major;</hi> for its poſſible that God making ſuch a diſtinction of men, might yet give his Son to die for both ſorts, eſpecially if that diſtinction, though made in his purpoſe, be made upon man as fore-conſidered,
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 1 4. Rom. 8.29.30. Jer 6 30. 2 Theſ. 2.10.11.</note> in a condition conſequent to Chriſts Death for them, as that of Election and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation is. Election beging in Chriſt, and Predeſtination to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to him in his Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which preſuppoſes him as inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing and dying, as the <hi>Prototype,</hi> to which they are to be confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:117749:71"/>and Reprobation (though according to Gods free VVill) yet for rejecting Chriſt, or the mercies afforded through him; for of no other to damnation do I read in Scripture. Its juſt ſuch another Argument as this. If God have diſtinguiſhed All men into two ſorts, good and bad, godly and wicked, righteous and unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ſays peculiarly of one ſort; He preſerves and keeps them, and never ſays ſo of the other, then he doth not afford preſervation to All; But he hath ſo diſtinguiſhed men; And he ſaith, The Lord preſerves the righteous, and preſerves all that put their truſt in him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But never ſays, He preſerves them that hate him, the unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and wicked, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore he doth not preſerve any of them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. His <hi>Minor</hi> is falſe, That he no where ſaies, He died for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort. For firſt, He that ſays he died for All, and the whole world, includes both ſorts, and if he expreſs his death in words, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding both ſorts, then its equivalent to his diſtinct mentioning of both. As he that ſaith, God made of one blood all Nations that dwell on the earth, and that he is the Saviour of All men, ſays as much, as if he had ſaid, He made, and is the Saviour of good and bad, righteous and ſinners, godly and ungodly, elect and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet the Scripture never uſes thoſe expreſſions. Now the Scriptures uſe as general expreſſions about Chriſts death, as it doth about the Creation, All, every one, the benefit to All men, the propitiation for the whole world; and therefore having theſe general expreſſions, comprehenſive of both, it is as much as both diſtinctly. 2. This diſtinction is in part thus, The Church and the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers and the unjuſt, godly and ungodly: now the Scripture uſeth theſe expreſſions that are in the worſer part of this diſtinction, as <hi>The ungodly, Rom.</hi> 5.6, 8. <hi>The unjuſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. <hi>The world,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5, 19. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Falſe teachers that bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. So that his <hi>Minor</hi> is evidently falſe.</p>
                  <p>If it be Objected, That its never ſaid, He died for the Reprobate. I anſwer, No more have we this expreſſion, He died for the Elect. If that its never ſaid For the veſſels of Wrath, ſo it is never ſaid For the veſſels of Mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſay theſe expreſſions are not in the Scriptures. And indeed there is good reaſon it ſhould not be ſaid for Reprobates, Goats, veſſels of Wrath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe God gave not Chriſt for them as ſuch; no more then its ſaid, He created Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, Devils, ungodly Men, becauſe they were not ſuch as created by him, but they after declined from him, and were rejected
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:117749:71"/>by him. So we ſay Chriſt dyed not for men as Reprobates, Goats, appointed to wrath, for they were the objects of theſe Decrees as viewed in an after-condition, as neglecting, refuſing and rejecting, the goodneſs of God and grace afforded through Chriſts mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for that he ſays in anſwer to our exception, that its no where us only, ſheep only, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we have taken it off before. Creation and preſervation and reſurrection and judgment, are alſo ſpoken of and applyed to <hi>Iſrael</hi> and believers, when they are ſpoken of with ſome diſtinction from, &amp; oppoſition to others, and yet in none of them are thoſe expreſſions ſufficient to prove that they are applicable to them only. One inſtance for Creation we gave in, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.14, 15. there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother like it in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.8. We are the clay &amp; thou art the potter, and yet the whole precedent part of the Chap. with the latter end of the former, ſpeaks in a diſtinguiſhing way between the people of God &amp; their adverſaries. So for preſervation, The Lord preſerveth the faithful <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.23. and the Lord preſerveth all them that love him, and yet there are oppoſitions between them and others, ſo for judgement, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.36. The Lord ſhall judg his people, and they diſtinguiſhed from their enemies. So for Reſurrection, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9, 11. there is an oppoſition of them that have not the Spirit of Chriſt in them, and them that have; and its ſaid, If the Spirit of Chriſt dwell in you he ſhall quicken your mortal bodies: Whether from thoſe and the like expreſſions its ſafe to ſay, God created and preſerveth none but his people <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the righteous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will quicken the bodies of and judg none but his people, and ſuch as have Chriſts ſpirit dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them, I leave to any rational man to judg. And whereas he ſays, <q>
                        <hi>By the ſame reaſon in other places when its ſaid Chriſt is the the way, the life, the reſurrection, It pleaſed God that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell, We might except too, and ſay, its not ſaid, Its he only and in him only.</hi>
                     </q> I anſwer the caſe is unlike, For if the Scriptures ſay ſo in other places, or extend it not in any other place to others, its boldneſs to extend it; but if the Scripture in other places affirms it of others, we may then well ſpeak againſt the putting in an <hi>only,</hi> to limit other Scriptures. The firſt is the caſe of thoſe places, the latter of this in controverſie, ſo that this exception is very anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; as for his confidence, that It may be further urged: when and where it is ſo, I hope I ſhall further anſwer it. In the mean time I have ſaid enough to ſhew the vanity of this Argument.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. His fifth Argument is,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Argu. </seg>5</label> 
                     <hi>That the Scripture no where ſays Chriſt
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:117749:72"/>dyed for all men,</hi> which is vain and evidently falſe, as was ſhewed <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>chap.</hi> 3. The expreſſion is plain, the righteouſneſs of one (which I think all muſt grant to be his obedience to the Death) to All men to juſtification of life, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. So he is the propitiation for the whole Worlds ſins, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.2. So the expreſſion in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. &amp; <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. &amp; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14, 15. are equivalent to an expreſſe mention of All men, as hath been ſhewed; And its againſt reaſon to ſay (as Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> intimates) that the Apoſtle there means all his Elect, his Church, children; ſeeing in thoſe places where thoſe expreſſions are, there is no mention of Election or Elect, Church, or Believers, to which the words may rationally be joyned, and its againſt reaſon to think that the Apoſtle in his writing ſhould more reſpect other writings, other Books or Chapters to refer his Adjectives to ſome words in them, or to ſome following verſes in the ſame Chapters, then to ſuch ſubſtantives as he in the ſcope &amp; drift of thoſe Scriptures in which thoſe Adjectives are, and in the preceding verſes of it was manifeſtly ſpeaking about, which in thoſe places, its manifeſt are Men. Beſides we might retort (and let Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> minde it) that no Scripture ſays in <hi>terminis,</hi> Chriſt dyed for his Church, Children, Elect, no one ſuch expreſſion: that in <hi>John</hi> 11.52. (which he points to) is not, He dyed for the children of God, but that he might gather into one the children of God. In <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.26, 27. (his other proof) its, He gave himſelf for his Church, which might be in exchange, thus, He gave himſelf to her to be hers, that ſhe might be his, holy to him. So <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. He purchaſed the Church by his blood, that is by the preaching and preſentation of his blood, (foreſhed) with the benefits thereby ratified to all that believe, and ſo gathered in or acquired and obtained (as the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <argument>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An Anſwer to his third Chapter containing two other Arguments.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>HIs ſixth Argument is, "<hi>That for whom Chriſt dyed, he dyed as a Sponſor in their ſtead: But he dyed not ſo for all,</hi> &amp;c. How much he puts into the word <hi>Sponſor,</hi> I know not well, but in their ſtead he dyed I grant; though his proofs might be queſtioned whether they will evince it. A man may dy for another, that is, for his ſake to do him good, when the other man perhaps ſhould not have dyed had not he dyed, and ſo not in a way of commutation: and if he might in any way dye for all, and not ſo for all, then his <hi>major</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valid; but yet I ſay I will grant that and deny his <hi>minor,</hi> but then he ſaith it will follow. That, 1. <q>
                        <hi>He freed them all from the anger and wrath of God, and guilt of death which he underwent for them.</hi>
                     </q> To which I ſay that will not follow, It will follow then, that he freed them from the death they ſhould have dyed, but not from all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or diſpleaſure that occaſioned him to ſentence to that death as in this caſe. A malefactor of an evil diſpoſition is condemned to dye for ſome evil fact; the day determined, and way preſcribed; another ſteps in and intreats for his life, to ſee if clemency may win him, or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that he may be more excuſeleſs if he perſiſt after this mercy ſhewed in his wickedneſs to a new condemnation, and whereas the ſentence is to be executed, he tenders ſastisfaction, perhaps to dy for him: upon this the others life is given him, but that the other being ill diſpoſed muſt needs be now made a favourite, or all the Kings anger wholly turned from him, it follows not; he may teſtifie yet ſuch diſpleaſure againſt him, as ill-conditioned: as to let him live at a diſtance from him, &amp; not put all his anger or diſpleaſure with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, ſo as to bring him into his favor &amp; fellowſhip, till this his accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another for him, and giving him conveniences for life though at a diſtance, with other means for winning him to a better diſpoſition, work upon him and make him better. So when <hi>Joab</hi> had mediated for <hi>Abſalom,</hi> and the King had reverſed his ſentence of Baniſhment, yet he was not well pleaſed with him. Suppoſe <hi>Joab</hi> had done it by exchange, become a baniſhed man that <hi>Abſolom</hi> might be called home, it would not follow that therefore <hi>David</hi> muſt receive him into his Court and make him a favorite, not being changed in his
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:117749:73"/>diſpoſition: Indeed he could not juſtly baniſh him and the other too, accepting that change for him, but he might juſtly yet ſhew diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure toward him, and only receive him into favor as he ſubmits to him. So is the caſe here, Reconciliation (and Juſtification with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into favor) ſuppoſe more then only ſatisfaction by way of commutation of puniſhment. It preſuppoſes alſo the parties ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to, and compliance with him that he is Reconciled to. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation is when two parties agree, not when one accepts the puniſhment of a third for a ſeconds fault, he ſtill retaining his evil diſpoſition. And when men are Reconciled, that is, brought to Gods tearms and into Gods favor, then he juſtifies them, ſo as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce them and accept them as righteous. Therefore let this be minded that I lay down as a poſitive truth. That though Chriſt ſuffered by way of commutation of penalty (and therein ſuſtained acts of diſpleaſure from God againſt the ſin of man) yet he did not ſuffer by way of commutation of affection; that is, God was better pleaſed with his Son in all his ſuffering, when his humane nature was under all its puniſhment, then with any man unconverted, while unconverted, though Chriſt hath dyed for him, and he be exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from that puniſhment. He was wel-pleaſed in his Son, in that he bare all our ſufferings, and he is angry with thoſe for whom he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered while not ſubmitted to him. And indeed if Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> thinks that Chriſt ſuffering for mens ſins, takes off all wrath and anger from thoſe for whom he ſuffers, then I would have him tell me, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt ſuffered not for all the ſins of the Elect? I know he ſays Yes: Then I demand whether any anger of God comes or lies upon any of them at any time? If he ſay No, then he ſpeaks contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to many Scriptures, and to his own conteſts with the <hi>Socinians</hi> in <hi>chap.</hi> 8. &amp; 9. If Yes, then he overthrows his own inferences here, and ſhews that he goes too far, when from the <hi>minor</hi> granted he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, "<hi>Then they reconciled, juſtified, and imputed righteous,</hi> &amp;c. And in this alſo is anſwered that objection from <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.36. <hi>The wrath of God abides on him.</hi> That is, God never comes to be at one with and welpleaſed with him, nor he ever comes to ſee life. As if <hi>Joab</hi> chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſentence of baniſhment with <hi>Abſalom,</hi> and <hi>Abſalom</hi> when called home refuſing by all loving Arguments to ſubmit himſelf to <hi>David, Davids</hi> diſpleaſedneſs with him abides, and ſome teſtimonies of it (as keeping him at a diſtance) abide on him, he never admits him to ſee his face; yea for perſiſting in Rebellion after this favor ſhewed
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:117749:73"/>him, He takes away his life from him. In which alſo his ſecond in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with the ſeveral branches of it are anſwered, as alſo they are before, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>chap.</hi> 2. for whereas he infers that 2. <q>
                        <hi>Then Chriſt made ſatisfaction for the ſin of all and every man;</hi>
                     </q> Its granted, as to that or thoſe ſins that brought that ſentence of death upon men, which occaſioned, and (as it were in the order revealed) required Chriſts coming to ſatisfie for them, that lire might be afforded to men and goodneſs extended to their perſons. See <hi>chap.</hi> 3. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. But his Aſſumption here (<hi>viz.</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>That he hath not ſatisfied for all the ſin of All,</hi>
                     </q> contains a <hi>quartus terminus,</hi> as I appeal to learned judgment. <hi>Joab</hi> might by commutation have ſatisfied to the penalty upon <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalom,</hi> impoſed for all his evil paſt, and yet it follows not from thence, that in that commutation (ſuppoſed) he ſatisfied for whatever ſhould follow his return from baniſhment; and ſo his after-rebellion. His three following reaſons then brought to prove that Chriſt ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied not for all the ſins of every man, fall as ſo many prevarications with his Aſſumption. As for Chriſts ſatisfying juſtice for them that were in hell before, we have anſwered it in <hi>chap.</hi> 2. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. we might a little alter his <hi>ſimile</hi> and illuſtrate it thus. A company of malefact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors being condemned to dy, one promiſes ſuch a ſum of money for their lives and freedoms from that ſentence, obtains it, the ſentence is reverſed, they are provided for and preſerved, and greater favor is profered to them upon tearms of compliance with him againſt whom they had ſinned; many of them rebell a ſecond time, and are taken and condemned anew and executed, others of them are won and become obedient ſubjects, and all this before the promiſed pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is performed. I ask now; ſeeing he that bought their lives had his bargain for that he compacted for, ſhall it be thought injuſtice for him who upon that promiſe ſpared their lives, to demand his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, becauſe they being then ſpared, afterward rebelled, and were anew condemned and executed? the caſe is like here: If God gave ſuch and ſuch favors to men upon Chriſts promiſe of payment, ſhall not he pay for it upon whoſe ſcore he gave them, what ere in the after eſtate become of them? His <hi>Dilemma</hi> is the ſame <hi>verbatim</hi> which we had in <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. Where we gave it its an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
                  <p>His ſeventh Argument is, <q>
                        <hi>For whom Chriſt dyed,
<label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Argu. </seg>7</label> for them he is a Mediator.</hi>
                     </q> I conceive thats true, for I think his dying for them was an high act of Mediation or coming between God and them.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:117749:74"/>"<hi>But</hi> (ſays he) <hi>He is not Mediator for All,</hi> becauſe then he muſt be Prieſt too for them, which he brings no proof for. <hi>Joab</hi> mediated for <hi>Abſalom,</hi> yet was no Prieſt for him; neither proves he that he is not Prieſt for All, not that he applies not that deliverance from the death that they ſhould have dyed, which by his dying he procured for them, to All. So that here we have a groundleſs, proofeleſs Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: though he ſaith it neeeds no proof, yet I think it needs more proof then he can bring for it in every particular. Object. <q>
                        <hi>But this makes but Chriſt at moſt an half Mediator. Anſ.</hi>
                     </q> But why ſo? If a man undertake to mediate for another to have his life ſpared, and obtains what he undertakes, ſhall that be imputed an injury in him, becauſe in ſo doing he did not alſo undertake he ſhould never ſuſtain any anger for any after-folly? If Chriſt do his work he undertook in Mediation, and that to ſatisfaction to the juſtice and will of God, who ſhall dare to call him but a half-Mediator; becauſe many a man refuſing to make uſe of his Mediation in higher things, that is, to come to God by him, deprive themſelves of the further acts of it, which he tels them they ſhall have if they will be ruled by him. A King and ſome Subjects are at difference, they are attached, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and muſt dy. A third between them comes and procures that the ſentence ſhall be reverſed, and favor ſhewed them from the King, and then goes to them and tels them, if they will follow his counſel and be ruled by him, as he hath procured their releaſe from that ſentence, ſo he will alſo bring them to be favorites and famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, ſome liſten to him and are ruled by him, and he performs his word to them to the utmoſt; others reject all his counſels, will not be beholden either to him or the King; being ſpared break out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to new inſolencies againſt them both, and for that are again con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and executed. Shall their wickedneſs be caſt as an imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon him, and make him be ſtiled but an half-Mediator, becauſe they refuſe the better half of the benefit they might have had by him?</p>
                  <p>If this be rational, let rational men Judg. I might illuſtrate it by the caſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> mediating for the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and yet refuſing to pray for, nay praying againſt the Rebels in <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. But I leave it, the matter being ſo evident.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>HIs eight Argument is thus. <q>
                        <hi>If Chriſts blood doth waſh, purge,
<label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Argu. </seg>8</label> cleanſe and ſanctifie them for whom it was ſhed, then certainly he ſhed his blood only for them that in the event are purged, cleanſed, and ſanctified. But All are not in the event waſhed, purged, cleanſed and ſanctified.</hi>
                     </q> Ergo <hi>He dyed not for All.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The conſequence of the <hi>major</hi> that he conceives undeniable, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably vitious, nor is it any way proved by him. The propoſition being reduced is thus. They whom Chriſt dyed for, are or ſhall be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified and purged by his blood. And ſo it being indefinite, its to be conſtrued Particularly or Vniverſally: if Particular, its <hi>peccant</hi> in this, that the <hi>major</hi> in the ſecond figure (in which this ſyllogiſme thus reduced, is) ought all to be Vniverſal. If conſtrued Vniverſally, as he muſt needs intend it (or elſe he ſays nothing) then I deny it, and he no where proves it, that All that Chriſt dyed for, are or ſhall be parged by his blood. The conſequence is like this. If they that came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> entred into <hi>Canaan</hi> by the river <hi>Jordan,</hi> Then they only came out of <hi>Egypt</hi> that paſſed over the river <hi>Jordan.</hi> But let us view the proofs of his <hi>major,</hi> as Vniverſally taken. <q>
                        <hi>He aſſays to do it, firſt by viewing the types, and then ſecondly by plain expreſſions:</hi>
                     </q> but firſt he halts in laying down his <hi>probandum,</hi> for in ſtead of this, That all that Chriſt dyed for are or ſhall be ſo purged, he propounds to prove, that <q>
                        <hi>The blood of Chriſt is effectual for all thoſe things, waſhing purging, ſanctifying;</hi>
                     </q> which I will grant him, where it is received by faith, but I ſay that comes no more up to the thing to be proved, then if a man ſhould affirm, That all that God brought out of <hi>Egypt</hi> were preſerved and kept till they injoyed <hi>Canaan,</hi> and then for proof produce ſome Scriptures that ſhew that thoſe that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God in his leadings of them, and believed in him, were ſo preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But let us ſee his proofes. And firſt, From the types he ſays, <q>
                        <hi>That the Apoſtle ſays that the expiation-ſacrifice legally ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the unclean, as is expreſt Heb.</hi> 9.13.</q> But by his leave the Apoſtle ſaith not, It ſanctified them all for whom it was a ſacrifice, but them whom it ſprinkled, the words are, ſprinkling the unclean ſanctifieth
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:117749:75"/>to the purifying of the fleſh; not, Being offered for the unclean, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſays, "<hi>Theſe are never divided though diſtinguiſhed:</hi> but I ſee no word to diſprove their being divided, though he ſays he was about it. Let us ſee if we can find any thing for proof of it; we will then appeal to the Law of the expiation-offering in <hi>Numb.</hi> 19. There we firſt finde a Commandment to take a red heifer and offer her up, and then gather the aſhes and keep them, and its ſaid, they ſhall be for <hi>The Congregation of the children Iſrael</hi> for a water of purification; the ſacrifice then was for a preparation of a purifying water for the Congregation; here is no exception or excluſion of any in that: That pertained to the Congregation, and then he tels them how they ſhould purifie themſelves with it, and in what caſes; but now mark what he ſays in <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. <hi>The man that ſhall be unclean, and ſhall not purifie himſelf with it, that ſould ſhall be cut off from the Congregation.</hi> It ſeems then God ſuppoſed the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion diviſible from the preparation of it, and appoints a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for thoſe that refuſe its application; <hi>Cutting off from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</hi> It ſeems he was of it before, and ought to have been ſprinkled and ſanctified with it, the refuſal of which and preſuming to approach to God without it, was to be puniſhed with cutting off from the Congregation. To which the Apoſtle I conceive alludes in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.24, 25. Ye are come to the blood of ſprinkling, take heed that ye refuſe not him that ſpeaketh;
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.2.</note> as in another place the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are ſaid to be choſen to the obedience and ſprinkling of the blood of Jeſus. Now unbelievers are diſobedient, and in what but in not yielding up themſelves to God and Chriſt to be ſanctified and cleanſed by his blood? So that Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> hath got nothing by that legal typicall expiation: his after exception about the Antitype to this, we ſhall ſpeak to in its due place. Let us now ſee the expreſs ſayings. His firſt is that in <hi>Rom</hi> 6.5, 6. <q>
                        <hi>If we have been planted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with him into the ſimilitude of his Death, we ſhall be alſo in the ſimilitude of his reſurrection, knowing that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve ſin.</hi>
                     </q> But <hi>quorſum haec?</hi> how doth this prove that all that Chriſt dyed for, are, and ſhall be ſanctified by his blood? Why he tels us, That the fifth verſe ſays, <q>
                        <hi>That a participation in the death of Chriſt, ſhall be accompanyed with a conformity to him in his Reſurrection.</hi>
                     </q> But what mean you, Sir, by a participation in it? an having part in it, or being a part of the object of it? If ſo, which
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:117749:75"/>word in <hi>ver.</hi> 5. ſays ſo? That ſays, He thats planted into the likeneſs of it, not, he that Chriſt died for. Surely if Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> had dealt fairly, he ſhould have kept the ſame tearms in both branches of his Aſſertion, as the Apoſtle doth, thus, Conformity to Chriſt in his death ſhall be followed with a conformity to him in his Reſurrection. Sure if planting into the likeneſs of him, ſignify conformity to him in the latter branch (as it doth) it ſignifies ſo in the former too, it being the very ſame maner of expreſſion. But Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> hath a little too much art of making <hi>quidlibet de quolibet.</hi> But what follows? <q>
                        <hi>The words of the later verſe yield a reaſon of the former Aſſertion. Becauſe our old man is crucified with him, that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed,</hi> &amp;c. [What gathers he from that? why this] <hi>That our ſinful cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and depravation of Nature, are by his Death and crucifying, meritoriouſly ſlain and diſabled from ſuch a rule and dominion over us, as that we ſhould be ſervants to them.</hi>
                     </q> But ſuppoſe this was the Apoſtles ſenſe, That Chriſt merited, that ſuch as are planted into the likeneſs of his Death by Baptiſm, or conformed to him in his Death, ſhould have their ſins ſubdued in them: will it therefore follow, That he ſays all that he died for ſhall be ſo conformed to him, or ſhall have their ſins ſubdued in them? Let Reaſon judg of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. But which word in the Text ſignifies a <hi>Meritorius ſlaying?</hi> I ſuppoſe he means the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. If ſo, I deny it. That ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies there a real crucifying in us, according to that in <hi>Gal</hi> 5.24 <hi>They that are Chriſts have crucified the fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. That is, have nailed it upon the Croſs, (that is, the Grace and Spirit of God, which is croſs to it, and luſts againſt it, they have given it up to be mortified by the Spirit) that ſo the body of <hi>Sin might be deſtroyed;</hi> It is not deſtroyed yet, nor doth the Apoſtle ſay ſo, as well he might, if he had ſpoken of a meritorious ſlaying; for what concerns the matter of Merit, that is already accompliſhed, though the thing merited be not. But when was this crucifying? I anſwer, when the ſoul was brought to give up it ſelf to Chriſt, and not before,
<note place="margin">Rom. 6.4, 5.</note> when it was Baptized into his Death (not in the outward onely, but chiefly in the inward ſpiritual Baptiſm, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21.) and ſo begun to be planted into the likeneſs of it. But perhaps he will ſay, The word is, <hi>Crucified with Chriſt,</hi> and therefore muſt be referred to what was done in his crucifying. I anſwer no, It ſignifies but a companion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in being crucified as he was, or after his ſimilitude, not a thing done when he was crucified, as <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. we are ſaid to be buried
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:117749:76"/>with him; but when was that? He ſays not, in his being buried, but in Baptiſm, which is a thing not inwardly accompliſhed, no, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun before believing. And ſo, <hi>You that were dead in ſins and treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes hath he quickned with him;</hi> the quickning men up to hope in God, and bringing them from their dead condition, in which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore believing they lay without hope, is ſaid to be with Chriſt. Yea, when we ſuffer for Chriſt, and dye for his Name, we are ſaid to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer and dye with him, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.11, 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. which are not to be referred to the time of his ſuffering and dying, as if we then ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered and died meritoriouſly with him. So that firſt expreſs ſaying, is preſſed too injuriouſly to ſpeak for Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> beſides its proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. <q>Again, He brings 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. <hi>All the Promiſes of God are in Chriſt Yea, and in him Amen.</hi>
                     </q> Which ſays nothing that God hath promiſed that All that Chriſt died for, ſhould be ſanctified and cleanſed from all their ſins, but that in him all the promiſes are ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be met with. The Covenant we have ſpoken to before. Thats made, or rather promiſed to be made with the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the Houſe of <hi>Judah,</hi> of which houſhold, men are not accounted, till brought to Chriſt to believe, as is plain, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2.12, 17, 18, 19. After Chriſt hath preached peace to us, and given us acceſs to the Father, then we are of the houſhold of God, and fellow Citizens with the "Saints. The promiſe of circumciſing the heart (which he mentions as moſt famous in the New Covenant) follows after obeying the voice of God in liſtning to his Son. <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. &amp; ſo the Apoſtle intimates, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16. When the heart turns to the Lord, the vail ſhall be taken away, which I conceive, anſwers to Circumciſing the heart. As impertinent to his purpoſe is that in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.23. of purging the heavenly things, (except he prove, that All that Chriſt died for, are heavenly men, even before believing, and before their calling to God with a heavenly call) And that in <hi>Col.</hi> 1.14. of the believer brought to Chriſt, receiving, and having the Redemption in him: with which agrees the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. which ſays not all that he died for are made wiſe, redeemed, righteous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by him, but they that are in him (by faith, as ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 16 7.) have him in the vertue of his blood, and by his Spirit, for wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſanctification and redemption. As impertinent is his allegation of <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. To deſtroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil, that he might free thoſe that by reaſon of death (or through the fear of death rather) were all their life time ſubject to bondage.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:117749:76"/>No more is his <hi>Probandum</hi> proved by that, then that all that Chriſt ſpake to are ſaved, can be proved by that in <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.34. <hi>Theſe things ſpeak I to you</hi> (you that had neither heard the voice of God, nor ſeen his face, <hi>And who will not come unto me that ye might have life,</hi> ver. 38.40.) <hi>that ye might be ſaved.</hi> Or from this, That he brought us into <hi>Egypt</hi> that he might bring us into <hi>Canaan,</hi> that all that came out of the one entred into the other. Nor is there any more conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence from the other places, mentioned in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.25, 26. and <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. <hi>He gave himſelf for his Church that he might ſanctifie it,</hi> provided in his death for the perfecting thoſe that ſhould believe in him; <hi>Ergo</hi> All he died for ſhall be ſanctified and ſaved. So that the contrary to his Concluſion is true, that he hath in no one place proved what was by him undertaken.</p>
                  <p>But to take off this that we ſay, Many are not ſanctified and purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it, becauſe they believe not, and thats the reaſon why his death hath not ſuch effects in them, not that Chriſt died not for them, therefore he undertakes to prove, <q>
                        <hi>That Faith it ſelf is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per immediate fruit and procurement of the death of Chriſt for all thoſe for whom he died.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quod ſi perficiat, fiet mihi magnus</hi> Apollo. But I fear it, for we ſee great undertakings hitherto, but little performances; <hi>Parturientes montes, erepentes verò mures.</hi> Before he come to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his promiſe, He premiſes ſome things which we muſt grant him, and ſhall as far as truth appears in them. He premiſes,</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <q>1. <hi>That what ever is freely beſtowed upon us, in and through Chriſt, that is wholy the procurement and merit of the death of Chriſt?</hi> But how proves he this? why he ſaith (but his ſayings are no proofs) <hi>that nothing is beſtowed through him on thoſe that are his which he hath not purchaſed, the price whereby he made his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe being his blood.</hi>
                     </q> If this ſaying were as firm as Scripture, and ſomewhat firmer, yet it would not reach his Aſſertion: for he limits it to thoſe that are his; now by thoſe that are his, is ſometime meant his peculiarly, owned by him as his, ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. And ſo I conceive Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> means it, and then he denies not here but that ſomething granted to others (not yet ſo his, that yet have not his Spirit in them) though through him may not be his purchaſe. But becauſe his words are no proof, and as to the main matter, its but <hi>Idem per idem,</hi> a repetition of his firſt ſaying, Let us carry it to his Scripture proofs, which are, (1.) <q>1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. I ſuppoſe he means <hi>ver.</hi> 19, 20. <hi>Your
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:117749:77"/>bodies are the Temple of the holy Ghoſt which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own, for you are bought with a price,</hi>
                     </q> Here is mention made of buying them with a price, but no mention made of his buying the holy Ghoſt, and their glorifying of God; and yet the holy Ghoſt was a gift freely given them through Chriſt, much leſs of all things given them freely in him; ſo that that proof reaches not. But then he adds out of <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53. <q>
                        <hi>That the Covenant made between his Father and him, of making out all ſpiritual bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings to them that were given him, was expreſly founded on this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that He ſhould make his ſoul an offering for Sin.</hi>
                     </q> But in viewing the place, I finde no ſuch expreſſions. It appears but a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that that is a Covenant made between the Father and Chriſt. For its not the Fathers ſpeech to Chriſt, or Chriſts to Him; but the Prophets of Chriſt to the Father, or of both Father or Son. When thou ſhalt make his ſoul [or when his ſoul ſhall make] an offering for ſin, he ſhall ſee a ſeed, he ſhall prolong his days, and the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand. He ſays not, My pleaſure, as ſpeaking in the perſon of the Father. Nor doth he ſay, becauſe his ſoul ſhall put a guilt-offering, or make an offering for ſin, therefore he ſhall ſee a ſeed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if his ſoul ſhall be ſo, or when it is ſo, then that ſhall follow. Much leſs ſaith he, that there was before that a people given him, that ſhould for that have all ſpiritual bleſſings made out to them. Indeed, in the twelfth <hi>verſe,</hi> there is a promiſe, and that grounded upon his interceſſion and ſufferings, but then the contents of it are not all good things to be given to men, but a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious portion to be given to Chriſt. So that he is deficient here too in his proofs.</p>
                  <p>And yet I will tell him how I will grant him this, though he prove it not; <hi>viz.</hi> that we had had none of thoſe things, had not Chriſt ſuffered (I ſpeak according to what is revealed, for ſecret things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain not to us.) He opened the way and paſſage for all good things to come unto us, by removing the ſin that did obſtruct, and hinder us of them. The earth, and we all in it were diſſolved, he bare up the pillars of it, and in him all things now ſtand together. (I know not whether M. <hi>Owen</hi> will except, or will alſo include Election, and Predeſtination to Sonſhip, for they are ſaid alſo to be in, and by Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4, 5. I ſhall leave that to his conſideration) but if, by procuring and meriting, he means that he ingaged God, and procured his good will, that ſuch things ſhould be beſtowed on
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:117749:77"/>us (eſpecially if by <hi>us</hi> he mean (as he muſt) all that he died for) ſo as that what ever God beſtows on any by Chriſt, he beſtows it out of debt to Chriſt, and ſhould be unjuſt to him, ſhould he beſtow leſs on (or deal any otherwiſe with) any particular in point of favour then he doth: that I cannot but queſtion till I ſee it better proved.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He propounds, <q>
                        <hi>That faith in men of underſtanding is of ſuch ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute indiſpenſible neceſſity to ſalvation, that what ever God or Chriſt hath done in his oblation and interceſſion for all or ſome, without this in us, is</hi> (in regard of the event to us) <hi>of no value, worth, or profit, but ſerveth onely to increaſe, and aggravate condemnation, it being certainly true, That he that believes not ſhall be damned</hi>
                     </q> (all which I conceive true, and what may be granted him with thoſe limitations ſpecified of [men of underſtanding] &amp; (in regard of the event to us) eſpecially where the Goſpel is plainly preached, that being evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the meaning of our Saviour in that laſt clauſe, <hi>viz</hi> that the Goſpel being preached by them, <hi>He that believeth not</hi> (the Goſpel ſo preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and thereby in himſelf) <hi>ſhall be damned;</hi> and yet I deny not but both in former times, and other caſes, he that by the light af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded, was or is not prevailed with to believe on God, and ſeek after him, and glorifie him as power was, or is vouchſafed thereto, ſhall be condemned alſo. But what infers he hence? It follows) <q>
                        <hi>So that if there be in our ſelves a power of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, and the act of it proceed from that power, then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is in our power to make the Love of God and death of Chriſt effectual towards us or not;</hi>
                     </q> To that I ſay, that no man doth at any time believe but he hath power to believe firſt in himſelf, and in that power he acteth; for the act of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving being an intrinſecal act of the ſoul, the power in which the ſouls acts in it, muſt needs be inward too, but I ſuppoſe he means ſo in our ſelves, as to be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, of our ſelves too; but ſo I ſay not that we have power in our ſelves, as meerly natural, without Grace preventing, and inabling us: And yet were it ſo, it would not follow that then its in our power to make Chriſts Death effectual to our ſelves but as its the preventing aſſiſting Grace of God that impowers the ſoul to believe. So the ſoul acting in that power, it ſtill remains in Gods Power onely to give it the promiſed efficacy, the ſoul
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:117749:78"/>in believing onely puts it ſelf into ſuch a poſture, as in which it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the object of Gods Promiſe, to make the death of Chriſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to it. As ſuppoſe I promiſe an alms to a poor man if he will come to my houſe for it, though it be in his power to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ome, yet its not in his power to make my promiſe effectual, that appertains to me, and is onely in my power ſtill. From this thats ſaid, his following concluſion <q>(viz. <hi>That this being the abſolute neceſſity of faith, the cauſe of that muſt needs be the prime and principal cauſe of ſalvation, as being the cauſe of that, without which the whole would not be, and by which the whole is, and is effectual</hi>)</q> nothing harms us, we making God the prime Cauſe our faith, and the Will be its freedom what it will, but inſtumental, and no inſtrumental ſubordinate cauſe (as the Will of man however conſidered, muſt needs be the whole man, and his Will being the Workmanſhip of God) though a <hi>cauſa ſine quâ non &amp; per quam totum,</hi> can be ſaid to be the prime cauſe. As to inſtance that in <hi>Acts</hi> 27.31. <hi>Except the Shipmen abide in the ſhip, the paſſengers could not have been preſerved.</hi> Their abiding in the ſhip was a cauſe of their preſervation, ſuch a one as without which they could not have been preſerved, and upon which they were preſerved, and yet, I hope, no man will be ſo graceleſs, as to conclude that they or the ſouldiers that cauſed them to ſtay, were the prime and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal cauſe of their preſervation. So a poor mans asking an alms may be a cauſe of his receiving an alms, and yet when ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers bounty propounding an alms to him upon that condition, incourageth him to ask, and gives him when he asks, though his Will be never ſo free in asking, yet it cannot be looked upon as the prime cauſe of his receiving. So that this premiſe too as it tends to conclude the act of the Will (from the former premiſes) to be the principal cauſe of our ſalvation, though ſpecious, is but fallacious and erronius.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. After both theſe <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>(as one that forgot what he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to prove, inſtead of performing his task) <q>
                        <hi>He puts it to our option, to chuſe whether we will anſwer directly and Categorically, whether Chriſt by his Death and Interceſſion merited and procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red faith for us or no.</hi>
                     </q> To this I ſay, as before, that except Chriſt had died for us, there had neither been a fit object for
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:117749:78"/>us ſinners to believe on, nor an inſtrument fit to beget it by, nor a power to work with that inſtrument to inable us thereunto. So that in that ſenſe he did by his death procure it for us, that is, removed that which hindred us from having any of thoſe; yet there too that he obliged God to give <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s</hi> individually faith, that is, to make us act faith in that object according to the power given us in the <hi>medium</hi> or inſtrument, ſo as that if God had not given <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s</hi> that in <hi>our individual perſons,</hi> he muſt have dealt injuriouſly with Chriſt, that I leave for him to prove. In the Interim, That he obliged him to give it to All he dyed for, that is, to cauſe them All to believe unto life eternall, I Categorically deny; and expect his proof of it; before which he ſeems to me to contradict his firſt premiſe, while he denies, <q>
                        <hi>That the granting a way of ſalvation (by bringing life and immortality to light by the Goſpel) in Chriſt</hi>
                     </q> (which paſſage he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes to <hi>T. More p.</hi> 35.) was procured for us by Chriſt. (To ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that I finde no ſuch paſſage in the place pointed to) why may we not ſay, this way was procured for us by Chriſt? Did not he procure the bringing life and immortality to light by the Goſpel? Sure then not all benefits beſtowed upon us (for that is one and none of the leaſt, which the Apoſtle alſo aſcribes to him in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.10.) and then neither did he procure faith for us; for he that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures a thing muſt procure all requiſites to the working of that thing, or elſe he doth not procure that thing. Now if he procure not the bringing life and immortality to light, then he procured not that we ſhould have that by which faith is effected, for thats it that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets faith, the appearing of light and immortality in the Goſpel; faith I ſay according to the preſent plainneſs of the Goſpel: and ſo he hath overthrown the thing he fights for. Ah, but <q>
                        <hi>its a ſtrange Contradictory Aſſertion that he ſhould procure a way to life in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> [But why ſo?] <hi>becauſe he is the chiefeſt part of this way, and ſure procured not himſelf by his own Death,</hi> &amp;c.</q> But by that reaſon, he procured few things freely beſtowed on us in and by Chriſt, for then neither did he procure us Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Holineſs, nor Redemption; for all theſe he is called himſelf as much as he is called the Way. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. then he procured not our peace, for he is our peace, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.14. He procured not our life, for he is our life, <hi>Col</hi> 3.4. But is it ſuch a ſtrange thing to ſay, ſuch a man got or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured himſelf to be made protector to ſuch a people, or to have the favor of admitting to or keeping out any from the Kings ear, by ſuch
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:117749:79"/>and ſuch ſervices and carriages? Surely no, And why then is it ſo to ſay that Chriſt procured himſelf to be the Way to life for ſinners by ſuffering for them? Was he the way to life to us without his ſufferings and death? I ſuppoſe not: and if not, then he obtained that power and title by his ſufferings,
<note place="margin">Heb. 5.9.</note> through that way he became our way to life, by ſufferings he was perfected, and ſo became the Author of ſalvation eternall to all that obey him. And is this ſuch a ſtrange Aſſertion? Sure I cannot but think it a juſt hand of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on men (as is propheſied <hi>Zech.</hi> 11.13. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.9, 10, 13, 14. <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.8, 9.) that becauſe they ſlight Gods Word, the plain teſtimonies of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, God ſmites their eye that they cannot ſee reaſon. But to return to our purpoſe. I deny, I ſay, that Chriſt procured (that is, ingaged or obliged God) that all ſhould be brought to believe on him for whom he dyed, though we deny not that he opened a paſſage for the grace of God to diſplay and glorifie it ſelf; ſo that He preſents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to men as good and powerful an object meet to be looked to, and ſtayed on, as in <hi>John</hi> 5.8, 9, 10, 11. eſpecially in the Goſpel as now publiſhed ſince the Appearance of Chriſt in the Fleſh, which preſentation of himſelf to men as good, grations, powerful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is the medium and inſtrument for begetting faith according to the degree and meaſure of the Revelation (as <hi>Rahab</hi> believed to juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by a leſſer revelation of God then <hi>Paul</hi> had, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.31. and ſo <hi>Cornelius</hi> before <hi>Peters</hi> coming to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in a lower act by leſs light then <hi>Peter</hi> brought to him, and the <hi>Ninivites</hi> by far leſſer then the <hi>Jews</hi> rebelled againſt) now that power accompanies theſe mediums too in their leſſer or greater diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, is evident, in that the Spirit is ſaid to have preached to &amp; ſtriven with men, even thoſe that yet obeyed it not, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6 3. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3 19. the hand of the Lord was ſtretched out with his reproofs and councels <hi>Prov</hi> 1.24. and in the effects it produceth, as that they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to ſome knowledg of God, convincements, illuminations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> againſt which they often willfully rebel and cloſe their eyes, and I ſay further, that God doth in many by theſe means effect faith, and bring them actually to believe, and I conceive many more might have faith, did they not wilfully turn away from God, for I conceive a fore going act propounded or injoyned to men (you may call it a condition if you pleaſe) upon which they might be brought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. Whereas Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> askes what that is? I anſwer, it is to liſten to the voice of God, not hardning the heart. So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.3. <hi>hearken
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:117749:79"/>diligently and your ſouls ſhall live:</hi> by diligent attendance to the voice of God the ſoul is quickned up to a life of faith and hope in God, ſo <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.1. <hi>Liſten O Iſles unto me, and hearken ye people from far,</hi> and in <hi>Pſal</hi> 95. <hi>To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</hi> Lift not up your reaſons and underſtandings againſt the authority of God, be ſwift to hear, hear him out and make not haſte to ſpeak and cavil againſt him. As alſo to minde thoſe demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of his Divine Power and Goodneſs that he affords, not winking with the eye, and wilfully turning from the light when he makes it appear, or from the means of light, which beheld, would give us to ſee what he holds forth to us, according to that Call, <hi>Hear ye deaf, and look ye blinde, that ye may ſee,</hi> Iſai. 42.18. So, <hi>Behold my ſervant whom I have choſen.</hi> ver 1. <hi>And look to me, and be ye ſaved,</hi> Iſai. 45.22. <hi>And conſider the works of God,</hi> Job 37.14. <hi>That that is to be known of God, is in them manifeſted,</hi> &amp;c. Rom. 1.19.20. But then, "<hi>Is not this ſame hearing and liſtening, believing?</hi> I anſwer, No, Its but a mean to it. We are to attend that we may believe; by this hearing, Faith and the ſpirit of it are given unto us. But it will be objected, "<hi>Its obeying, and obeying is believing.</hi> So M. <hi>Owen.</hi> But there is a fallacy in that; for neither is every Act of hearing, obeying; nor every Act of obeying, the believing ſpoken of. As obeying in ſome acts follows believing, ſo in ſome it may be but a tendency to the meeting with that which will cauſe us to believe, &amp; ſo believing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to obey. Take this <hi>Simile.</hi> Two men are at controverſie, ſuppoſe a Maſter and a Servant, the Maſter would have him do ſuch things as the ſervant doth not, nor will, The Maſter begins to expoſtulate with him, and to ſhew him reaſons for his demands, the ſervant hears what he ſays, this is not yet an act of obedience to his Maſter, for perhaps he may yet prove refractory, and more obſtinate then before, and perhaps in hearing he may be perſwaded, and become obedient to him, being convinced and changed in minde by what he hears, till which change his act of hearing will not denominate him obedient, or paſs for an act of obedience. Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſaith, <q>
                        <hi>If we can propound a condition for Faith that is not Faith, he will hear it,</hi>
                     </q> And yet I ſuppoſe he will not think his hearing us propound it, an act of obedience to us at all. But then he ſays, <q>
                        <hi>This is procured by by Chriſt or not.</hi>
                     </q> In the ſenſe before explained, we grant it procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; otherwiſe not: and that to the power of exerciſing it is abſolute, but as to the act of exerciſing of it, its voluntary, and to the moſt,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:117749:80"/>uncompelled, or unneceſſitated. Many have abſolute power and ability given them of hearing and ſeeing the hints of Light and Truth that come from God, that yet have it in their choiſe, whether they will act ſo or ſo; and therefore are faulted for not acting as they might, for not chuſing the fear of the Lord, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.29.30. For ſhutting their eyes againſt his Light, and ſtopping their ears, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.15. <hi>Acts</hi> 28.27. And yet the cauſe of Faith is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved into our ſelves, but into him that gives the power to hear, and that ſpeaks ſuch words when we do liſten, as overcomes our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and our hearts. Our faith is juſtly ſtill aſcribed to him. For if he ſpake not we could not hear, yea, if he gave us not power to hear; yea, if when we hear, he ſpake not ſuitable words, and exerciſed not power with his words, we ſhould not yet believe in him. So that Inference is as abſurd as theſe, That becauſe the blind man went and waſhed in the Pool of <hi>Siloam,</hi> Therefore he was the cauſe of his own healing, or Not Chriſt ſo much as he; and The ten Lepers were the cauſe of their own cleanſing, becauſe they went on their own legs to ſhew themſelves to the Prieſts at his Commandment. VVe avoid alſo all his following Conſequences. If by procuring Faith, he means his meriting and obliging God to cauſe all to believe in him for whom He died. For denying that, it follows not either,</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <q>1. <hi>That Faith is an act of our own wills, and ſo our own as not to be wrought by Grace, and that its wholly ſited in our own power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that ſpiritual act.</hi>
                     </q> No ſuch thing follows upon that Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion denied. (1.) That Faith is an act of the VVill, no man can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, for in it the Will cloſes with an Object propounded as good to be relied on, but that its not wrought by Grace is clearly falſe, from what is ſaid above. Its our act to hear, and yet not that without the VVord of God, buts tis Gods Act, even the act of his Grace, to perſwade us by what he ſpeaks to lean upon him, and believe in him. Beſides, (2.) God might freely work it in ſome without being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to it by the Death of Chriſt, the ſame love that led him to give Chriſt, may (ſin being removed, and the enmity being ſlain by Chriſt) work as much as it pleaſes, without being obliged and tied to work it. Beſides, (3.) Chriſt might oblige him to work it in ſome, and yet not in all He died for. So that every way this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſequent. And we neither,</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <q>1. <hi>Contradict any Scripture, Nor</hi> 2. <hi>Speak contrary to the nature

Nor yet is the <hi>Minor</hi> without exception.
<note place="margin">Luke 8.17.</note> For faith is ſcarce a fruit of Election in all that believe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſuch as believe for a time were elected for a time too.

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:117749:81"/>eyed was the object of predeſtination, and not men fore-known as future believers, to which in time they are called. So that though that Scripture in a manner couples them, yet it ſays not Faith (at leaſt in all that believe) is the fruit of Predeſtination or Election. Much more is that in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. impertinent to that its brought for, for (as <hi>Beza</hi> alſo expounds it, and as any man that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly mindes the Apoſtles duft in the three foregoing Chapters, and in the verſe before may ſee) the Apoſtle is not ſpeaking of men differenced from the world by believing, in compariſon with the world, but of believers differing from one another in gifts, and crying up one above another, according to that difference, or lifting up themſelves for that one above another. Nor is the difference he ſpeaks of in the act of believing, as if one had believed, and another not, (as if he had ſaid, Who made thee to receive) but in the matter of their receits, who had all received ſomething. <hi>What haſt thou that thou haſt not received?</hi> The meaning is, Believers are not to lift up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or one another, one above another, for their gifts, in that one hath more, or better gifts then another, and ſo not to fault and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own them that have leſs, and dote on them that have more. But they may fault and diſown them that believe not, and commend them that do, and they have good warrant ſo to do, which they might not, if the want of Faith in men was becauſe there was none for them. A company of poor beggers receiving alms, ſome ſix pence, ſome a ſhilling, have no cauſe to brag one over another, and fault one another, when the gift was free to each, and not out of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert to any more then other, yet they may fault other beggers, and glory over them that were ſlothful, and refuſed to go where they went for the alms. So that thats impertinent. That in <hi>Acts</hi> 13.48. ſeems to have the greateſt force for proof, that Faith is in ſome the fruit of Election.

So <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.8. <hi>They have known and believed,</hi> in oppoſition to thoſe that believed for a time, and then fell away; theſe continued believing. And ſo in <hi>Acts</hi> 17.34.

Theſe things we have noted on the <hi>Minor,</hi> though the faultineſs of the <hi>Major</hi> is ſufficient to overthrow the Argument in the thing that ſhould have been concluded, <hi>viz.

So that Chriſt may be affirmed to be the Author of their eternal and perfect ſalvation there mentioned, and yet not the procurer of their faith.

                     </gap>) omitted) yet it follows not, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that it was given them as his purchaſe. I may give a man a thing for my childs ſake, becauſe I love him, and would have him eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and loved, which yet is not by him bought of me for that man. Or if ſo, yet it follows not that Chriſt did ſo for all that he died for.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:117749:83"/>Chriſt might procure that God ſhould abſolutely make ſome believe in him, and yet leave him to glorifie his Mercy or Juſtice on others as he pleaſes, leave them to ſuch grace as whereby they might have been brought to believe in walking out in the means according to power given; yea, leave it wholly to the meer VVill of God, whom to cauſe to believe, both as to perſons and their number. So that no wayes doth this Argument conclude. Nor doth <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.3. (another place urged by him) ſpeak of Faith, they being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers that were ſpoken of in that Speech, as the <hi>Suppoſitum</hi> in it. And how it ſhould be meant when he ſays, <hi>My Dinner is prepared, and all things are ready, come ye to the Wedding,</hi> That the peoples coming was one of the diſhes prepared, I know not, or that God hath put faith into Chriſt for us. Yet ſuppoſe it mean that through him God hath bleſſed us with faith (which I grant he hath, ſuch as do believe) yet how either he obliged God to bleſs ſuch particulars ſo, or (much more) all that he died for, I am ſure no man can ſhew me from that proof. So that Jeſus is the Author and Finiſher of our faith, the beginning and the end of what we believe for, or (as the word is) the <gap reason="foreign">

If the <hi>Major</hi> be not ſo univerſal, then we deny the Conſequence. For we ſuppoſe Chriſt might procure ſome things not for All, as the grace of Apoſtleſhip for <hi>Paul,</hi> and thats not common to all the Church, yet it follows not from that that he died not for all the Church. Again, The terms for whom he died are equivocal, for its either to be interpreted, All for whom he died had the grace of <hi>Faith</hi> procured for them, to be abſolutely beſtowed on them or not. If not, then it comes not up to the intent of the <hi>Major,</hi> nor takes in the whole middle Term of it as it ought to run. If ſo, we have ſeen no proof for it, and therefore (to ſay no more, that the whole <hi>Minor</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains unproved) the main thing oppoſed by him yet ſtands firm, <hi>viz.

                        <hi>Thoſe onely are ſpiritually redeemed by Chriſt, who were typed out by the people of</hi> Iſrael <hi>in their carnal typical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: But by the people of the</hi> Jews, <hi>in their deliverance out of</hi> Egypt, <hi>bringing into</hi> Canaan <hi>with all their Ordinances, and Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, onely the Church of God, the Elect, were typed out</hi>
                     </q> (which he ſayes was proved before, but I never yet ſaw it proved from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Book hitherto, and I am confident never ſhall) <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. Truly this is a very ſorry Argument, and I had thought ſuch a man as Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> would not have mentioned ſuch a one; but ſure he ſo much over-reaſoned himſelf in the former, that he forgat himſelf here. For firſt, to the <hi>Major,</hi> He hath no proof for it at all, and this reaſon may be given to deny it, that he can no where prove, that that was a type of Chriſts dying for us meerly. But out of courteſie we will grant it him, and fall upon his <hi>Minor,</hi> in which he both adds a <hi>Quartus terminus,</hi> in mentioning the bringing them into <hi>Canaan,</hi> and all their Ordinances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not mentioned in the <hi>Major,</hi> and in ſaying, Onely the Elect and Church of God was typed out by them, ſaith falſely, and ſo its denied by me upon theſe grounds. 1 The beaſts were all brought out to a hoof, of which ſome were clean and ſome were unclean for Sacrifice, were all theſe types of the Elect and Church onely? 2. The Murmurers and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels that fell in the Wilderneſs were brought out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> were
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:117749:84"/>they alſo types of the Elect? Sure then if <hi>Canaan</hi> be a type of heaven, and heavenly Reſt, and <hi>Egypt</hi> a type of the Kingdom of Death and Darkneſs, then it will follow, That few of the Elect, ſcarce two of ſix hundred thouſand ſhall enter into Reſt, and that many that Chriſt died for, and ranſomed from death and miſery through unbelief, ſhal never come into heavenly glory. Was not <hi>Corah</hi> and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſome of that people that was redeemed out of <hi>Egypt?</hi> Sure they were. See <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. and yet the Apoſtle tells us they were types of them that periſh for rebellion againſt Chriſt. <hi>Jude</hi> 11. Were they, think you, the Elect of God? And ſo the Apoſtle propounds thoſe Murmurers and Fornicators, and Idolators amongſt them, as types of them that now murmure againſt Chriſt, and commit Fornication and Idolatry againſt him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5, 11. So that this Argument is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly erroneous. Let us turn it thus rather. All that were typed out in the Redemption from <hi>Egypt,</hi> are ranſomed ſpiritually by Jeſus Chriſt. But all men, good and bad, were typed out by them. <hi>Ergo,</hi> All ſo ranſomed, To make good the <hi>Minor</hi> (for the <hi>Major</hi> is Mr. <hi>Owens</hi> own.) The clean beaſts typified thoſe of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> that are fit for ſacrifices to God, being ſanctified by the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.16. The unclean, thoſe that remain in unbelief, and ſo are not fit to be ſo offered up, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.16. Likewiſe the good and faithful people, and ſuch as were choſen into Office, types of the Elect, and faithful in Chriſt Jeſus, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. And the Murmurers, Complainers, and Unbelievers, types of the diſobedient to, and backſliders from Chriſt. Therefore all ſuch people, though they come not all to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, yet Chriſt gave himſelf a ranſom for them. But enough to this moſt incongruous Argument.</p>

                        <hi>If Chriſt pay a price for Redemption, his aim is their deliverance for whom its paid, to that end he ſatisfies the Judge, and conquers the Jaylor, but this agrees not to All, All are not ranſomed.</hi>

From the firſt death they are, from the ſecond they are not, becauſe many are diſobedient againſt their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. As all <hi>Iſrael</hi> were ſaved out of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jude 5.</note> (Its the Apoſtle <hi>Judes</hi> expreſſion) But why then not all preſerved into <hi>Canaan?</hi> He tells us, He afterwards deſtroyed them that believed not. So here, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward in a ſecond death deſtroyes all thoſe that know (like, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove) not God, and all that diſobey the Goſpel of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.7, 8. All were in thrall to the ſentence of death, and ſo to the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of vengeance from God upon them all in <hi>Adam</hi> in an utter ruine; and again, for ſlighting and ſinning againſt Light and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs afforded, deſerve deſtruction to come ſuddenly upon them, in plagues, famines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The bond that held them in the former was their ſin in <hi>Adam,</hi> and to the latter many ſins againſt Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs now expoſes them. VVhat price pays Chriſt? Himſelf, to bear that blow for them, and be the propitiation for their ſin. Now in that the ſentence paſſed not (or rather lyes not) upon men. Men are not debarred reacceſs to God, for that folly the ſentence of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is reverſed, and the baniſhed called home again, here is a
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:117749:85"/>Redemption made from that thraldom. And whereas many times they are liable to deſtruction again in their perſons, Chriſt Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and Interpoſing himſelf as the Propitiation, preſerves them. And on this ground we are to pray for All, and make Interceſſion with thankſgiving for All, as in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.2, 6. But, I ſuppoſe, he thinks All not ranſomed, becauſe many remain thralled in their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. To which I might ſay but as <hi>Proſper, Ad capit. Gallor. Sanguis Chriſti eſt totius mundi pretium, pro omnium redemptione verè perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutum,</hi> (and thats as much as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. ſays) <hi>ſed illi homines ab eo pretio extranei ſunt, qui aut captivitate delectati redimi noluerunt, aut poſt redemptionem ad eandem ſervitutem ſunt reverſi;</hi> and again, <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes rectè dicantur redempti, ſed non ownes a captivitate eruti.</hi> But to clear it, I ſhall propound theſe following conſiderations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That men in ſinning fell under a double bondage. 1. To death to be inflicted from God, according to his ſentence, <hi>In the day thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt die the death, and death came on all, in that all ſinned.</hi> 2. To corruption, or ſinfulneſs of Nature in themſelves, and the deluſions of Satan, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, conceived in ſin, and born in iniquity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The latter of theſe thraldoms, was not the curſe, or death in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted as the puniſhment of the fall, but the proper conſequence of it. That it was not its puniſhment, nor any eſſential part of it, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in this, that every eſſential part of the puniſhment of it Chriſt was to bear by way of ſatisfaction, and ſo he bare anguiſh in body and ſoul, death of body, and ſeparation from Gods preſence: but he bare not the inherency of ſin for us, nor inability for ſerving his Father, nor was he ſubject to the deceits of Satan, as if it had been an eſſential part of that puniſhment he muſt have done, for it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains to, and ſpreads over the whole nature. But the firſt was the puniſhment to which we were ſubjected, and which, had we abid never ſo pure in our natures, muſt have been executed for the fault committed, becauſe the word was not, If thou becomeſt ſo pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted, but <hi>In the day thou eateſt thou ſhalt die,</hi> and therefore Chriſt alſo ſuffered that, becoming a ranſom for us though innocent.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the latter the Juſtice of God did not detain us (but as man being debarred from any new grace, without that could not do what he ſhould) but we ought (that notwithſtanding) to do our beſt to ſerve him, we had his permiſſion to it; if ſuch a thing might be ſuppoſed, that we might have lived under that ſentence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffered
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:117749:85"/>for us. He neither put ſin into us, nor kept it in us. But the former came directly from God upon us, and his Juſtice detained us in our Mediator, in it, till his ſentence was ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That firſt was the death of which Satan had power, and the fear of which (though but now a carkaſs) detains men in their ſpirits in bondage, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. Men fear not, but love the other, their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions; now Chriſt conquered Satan, when he brake his ſnare, and got victory over that death, that ſhould elſe have ſwallowed us up for ever. So that Satan could not, as elſe he would have done, play the Executioner upon us.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. God neither putting men into corruption, nor corruption into them, nor his Juſtice ſtanding againſt our doing better (he would that they ſhould come out of it, if they could) the price was not given to God properly as the price of Redemption from that, but onely as the ranſoming them from the death inflicted, makes a paſſage for means alſo to be afforded to them for their recovery and ſetting free from that bondage too. Were it not for this Ranſom, he would not afford him any means to help him out of this, but his Juſtice required not any poſitive influence upon him to hold him in, and hinder him from getting out of it till he was ſatisfied in the other. Thence Chriſt given himſelf to bear the blow, and deliver men from that proper puniſhment inflicted by God, and men being thereby delivered out of that ſentence, they may be ſaid properly to be ranſomed, though ſtill they are not brought out of the bondage to their corruption; eſpecially the priſon door being opened, with help afforded for their coming out of that too. To clear it by a <hi>Simile.</hi> A King makes a Law, That he that ſhall eat ſuch a fruit (ſuppoſe as in the eating of it, hath a property to make men leprous) ſhould for ſo doing be forthwith adjudged to death, and executed. A certain company of men notwithſtanding, being overcome by ſome evil inticement, tranſgreſs the Law and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately become leprous. The Executioners ſeize upon them, and are drawing them to puniſhment, in the interim one gives a ſum of money for their ranſom. The intention of it is to ranſom them from the ſentence to the execution of which they are going; the ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or performance of the paiment being accepted, he that gave the price receives power to reſcue them from the Tormentors, and doth it: ſtill they remain leprous, and lye expoſed to the ſubtilty of former inticers: ſhal we ſay now, theſe men are not ranſomed, or that
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:117749:86"/>he that payed the price, ranſomed them not, becauſe they remain leprous? Nay, we will go further, ſuppoſe the Ranſomer obtaining by the ſame price the beſt Surgeons, and skilful Phyſitians for their healing too, and by all loving Arguments intreating them to be healed, and no longer to hearken to the contrary ſuggeſtions of their inticers, ſome of them truſt him and are healed, others pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily liſtening to their inticers like their leprous condition bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe they like not the Ranſomers ſociety, and think they ſhall not be troubled with it ſo long as they are leprous, having great ſuſpition alſo perhaps that the things he preſcribes for them will poyſon them, and ſo refuſe to be healed, and abide lepers all their dayes, yea, perhaps alſo for diſobedience to their Ranſomer and the King again, come to be again condemned and executed; ſhall we ſay now that this man did not give a price of Redemption for them all, becauſe they through their folly, were never freed and redeemed, as it were, from the power of their leproſie? Such is the caſe in hand, I need not to apply it, the caſe is ſo clear. If it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, That Similitudes prove nothing. I Anſwer, There is no need of proving a Scripture ſaying, that's to be believed, and Similitudes may be apt to illuſtrate how we may conceive the thing expreſſed ſutably to the expreſſion in Scripture uſed. Let me this ſay further, that the word Redemption is ſometime applied to the effect of the believing application of the blood of Chriſt, for healing men, in regard of their corruptions, and ſetting their mindes free to ſerve God, as in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9. and 14.3, 4. being the ſame in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with <hi>Heb</hi> 9.14. As alſo ſometimes for a powerful freeing the body from mortality, weakneſs, and death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. In which fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſignifications, it is not to be confounded with the uſe of it here, but diſtinguiſhing from it.</p>

So that this place duly weighed, rather overthrows Mr. <hi>Owens</hi> Aſſertion, then contributes any the leaſt mite to its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation. He produces alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.15. <hi>The caſting off of the</hi> Jews <hi>is the reconciling of the world,</hi> which neither ſpeaks a title of Chriſts death; nor can be underſtood to make any thing for a <hi>meritorious</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling, Reconciliation there ſignifying only the occaſional way and means of reconciling; As Salvation, <hi>Acts</hi> 28.28. is the means of ſaving. He quotes alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. <hi>If being enemies we were recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God by the Death of his Son,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Col.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Now are ye reconciled in the body of his fleſh through death.</hi> But neither will they ſerve him up to his purpoſe. For neither of them, either ſpeak in that latitude as All for whom Chriſt died, nor of a meritorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling onely; but of Reconciliation at leaſt <hi>inchoativè</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed in mens perſons. In <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. The Apoſtle having ſaid,
<note place="margin">Verſe 1.</note> That the believer being juſtified by faith in Chriſt, is at peace with God (which is all one with,
<note place="margin">Ver. 2, 3, 4, 5.</note> is reconciled) and is lead to rejoyce in the hope of the glory of God even in afflictions, ſhews how Faith nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes and acts the ſoul in that hope, from what principle, and by what conſiderations, <hi>viz.</hi> By minding the great love of God in giving his Son to the Death for it, when in a miſerable condition,
<note place="margin">Ver. 6, 7, 8.</note> and the great love of Chriſt in ſo dying for it, and the ſtate to which God hath there-through already brought it, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ver. 9, 10.</note> A juſtified and reconciled eſtate. VVhence it leads the ſoul thus hopefully to judge and reaſon. Hath God ſhed his Sons blood for me, that I might have good ground of believing in him, and overcoming me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve therein: hath he juſtified me there-through? (Compare <hi>ver.</hi> 1.9. with <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.25.) how ſhall he not much more now ſave me (me, or us that are thus juſtified) from wrath to come? And again, Hath God made me of an enemy his friend by ſuch a way, &amp; at ſuch coſt as the death of his Son? how much more wil he now that I am no more his enemy but his friend, reconciled to him, ſave (preſerve me in, and bring me ſafely out of all afflictions and trials unto glory) by his life, ſeeing he ſhall not need to die again to do that for me? Yea, not only ſo ſays he, but it leads too to Glory in God himſelf through Jeſus Chriſt, through (or by) whom it hath now (now that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves and is juſtified,) received the atonement, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, by a Metonymy, the Grace of God that effected this reconciliation, and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:117749:88"/>brought it in to be the reconciled of God, as he had before (<hi>ver.</hi> 10.) affirmed. He ſays not, we were reconciled in the time of Chriſts dying, that would have been rather <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. But the reconciliation which we now have received (in receiving him, to wit) and in which we are reconciled, we have it by his Death. That phraſe, <hi>By his Death</hi> that men ſo ſtumble at, I have explained before, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. This then ſays nothing of Chriſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting of, or obliging God to reconcile, that is, turn the affections of all to himſelf for whom he died: nor ſays that in <hi>Col.</hi> 1.21, 22. any thing more for it, but that the believing <hi>Coloſſians</hi> were of enemies to God become now his friends reconciled to him, onely the Apoſtle there tell us what was the bond or <hi>medium</hi> of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, <hi>viz.</hi> The body of Chriſts fleſh, through, or by means of death, that is, he having in that his body ſuffered for our ſins, and offered up himſelf to God, God there takes up his delightful dwelling, and is propitious towards us; now we alſo by Faith, cloſing with, and feeding on that his body as it hath (or he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in) died for us, God and we are at one, But what is this to his meriting of God that he actually reconcile all for whom he died?</p>
                  <p>His laſt proof is <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.15, 16, where the Apoſtle having ſaid that the <hi>Epheſians</hi> ſometimes ſtrangers to God and his Church, were now made neer by the blood of Chriſt; which we may either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand of that cleanſing of the ſtate of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in general, and opening a free acceſs into his Kingdom to them, of which we ſpake above, or elſe more eſpecially of the believing <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſuch as the <hi>Epheſians</hi> written to, made of one body with the believing <hi>Jews,</hi> he ſhews how that nighneſs was effected, <hi>viz.</hi> in Chriſt our peace, and how he is our peace, <hi>viz.</hi> in that he hath broken down the partition wall, and ſo ſlain the enmity, the Law of Commandments in Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances in his croſs or ſufferings. Which work of his he amplifies by his ends in it. <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That he might create of two peoples, one new man in himſelf, which is done in their believing on him. 2. That he might reconcile them in one body unto God, that is, in his own body fed on by both, or in one myſtical body conſiſting of both, by the Croſs, that is, the vertue of his ſufferings, having ſlain the enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty there, as above, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. Now note that he ſays not, he reconciled them to God in dying, (no more then that he had new created them therein) but he ſlew the enmity there, that is, the power of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:117749:88"/>the Law upon us, which was the bond of enmity and difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, that by it he might reconcile us, that's ſpoken of as a further and future thing to his dying and ſlaying the enmities. Unto which alſo it follows that he came and preached peace to them. So that this proves not Reconciliation of man to God, an immediate fruit of his death, but through the interpoſition of the Word and Spirit, and Faith, (as <hi>ver.</hi> 18.) bringing us to feed on that one body of Chriſt, and into one body with the Saints of God. Much leſs is there is any Scripture ſaith, That Chriſt merited, that all for whom he died, ſhould be effectually brought in to be friends to God. He is indeed worthy to be believed on by us, as I ſaid before, but hath no where obliged God to cauſe us in ſo doing to become at one with him. So that that Argument alſo is a groſs miſtake. And this takes off all the following Queries in that Chapter, which need no other Anſwer. Onely there is a touch in it needs a little clearing.

<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Inſtan.</hi> 3.</note> containing the ſame Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in ſubſtance that we have anſwered before in <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. and <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. The main thing in it is, <q>
                        <hi>That for whom Chriſt died, All their ſins he ſatisfied for: And therefore being juſt he ought to diſcharge them,</hi> &amp;c.</q> But firſt he fails in the proof of both. He proves not that Chriſt undertook to ſatisfie for all the ſins of All he died for, as well Conſectaneous as Antecedaneous to his Mediation, for ſuch a proof would be to ſome purpoſe, and make the Apoſtles caution, as well as our perſwaſion ridiculous: it would be out of fear that any man ſhould occaſion one to periſh for whom Chriſt died, ſeeing whatever ſin ſuch a one can commit, is paid for and diſcharged beforehand. So that I ſay, Thoſe paſſages in <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.15. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.11. would be as vain, as if he had ſaid, Take heed leſt ye annihilate Chriſt, or ſwallow him up through ſorrow, in the mids of all his glory. Such kinde of vain intimations, are not to be fixed on the Apoſtles Doctrine. But if it be true indeed, that there the Apoſtle ſuppoſes, <hi>viz.</hi> That a man for whom Chriſt died, may by ſtumbling at Chriſt, and departing from him, periſh: then is it not true that Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> propoundeth, that for ſuch ſins as any do ſo commit, Chriſt hath ſo fully ſatisfied, that the forgiveneſs of them is due debt, and God unjuſt in caſe they for them periſh. We grant he hath ſatisfied to the utmoſt of that Obligation that he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook, and ſo removed the ſentence of death from off all that the benefit of his righteouſneſs is to All to juſtification of life; but not that he hath made the remiſſion of all ſins paſt, preſent, and to come
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:117749:89"/>for all for whom he died due debt, ſo as that its unjuſt that any periſh for them. The onely place he brings to prove it, is 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. which he ſeems not to underſtand; for that neither ſaith The blood of Chriſt hath cleanſed All them for whom he dyed, from all their ſins, that they have or ſhall commit; nor that it cleanſeth all us (abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely) from all our ſins: but it ſaith, <hi>If he walk in the light, as he is in the light,</hi> (that is (in other Scripture phraſe) If we walk in the Spirit, and continue rooted and grounded in the Faith, and be not moved from it) <hi>then have we fellowſhip one with another, and the blood of Jeſus Chriſt cleanſeth us from all our ſins.</hi> He forgot that [<hi>If he walk in the light,</hi> &amp;c.] Its the ſame in meaning with that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>There is no condemnation to thoſe that are in Chriſt Jeſus, that walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit.</hi> He ſaith not There is no condemnation to any that Chriſt hath died for, nor to all in Chriſt Jeſus; for ſome ſuch may be unfruitful branches, and grieve and rebel againſt the Spirit, and ſo be cut off.
<note place="margin">Joh. 15.4.</note> Its like that too in <hi>Col.</hi> 1.23. <hi>To preſent you blameleſs, and unreproveable in his ſight, if ye continue ſtedfaſt,</hi> &amp;c. The meaning, in a word, is this, That ſuch is the force of the blood or ſufferings of Jeſus Chriſt with God, and ſuch Gods wel-pleaſedneſs in that his obedience, and ſuch the mutual conſent of God and Chriſt upon his ſufferings, That whoever receiveth the light that comes from God, &amp; walks therein, as God is in it affording power and ſtrength to him there-through, with him God hath fellowſhip, and him God admitteth into commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with himſelf (or ſuch have joynt participation one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) &amp; are preſented ſpotleſs in the ſight of God. So as that though they have ſin in them that hinders them from doing as they would, from attaining to walk in that heighth &amp; perfection that they deſire, yet they not yielding to that ſin but ſiding with the light and Spirit of God againſt it, God imputes it not to them. All ſuch mens ſins, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſins of weakneſs to which they are meerly drawn, are ſo covered, that there comes no condemnation upon them for any of them, no rebuke from God, nor
<note n="*" place="margin">So <gap reason="foreign">

The blood of Jeſus Chriſt believed in, preſenting the ſoul ſpotleſs to God, and ſpeaking peace unto the conſcience. But now its neither ſo with all that Chriſt died for, nor with all that are in Chriſt. Such as walk after the fleſh, and ſow to it (though believers) do and ſhall of the fleſh reap corruption. Its not the agreement between God and Chriſt, that his blood or ſufferings, ſhould preſent men in that
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:117749:90"/>condition unblameable before him, his blood ſpeaks no ſuch prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to ſin, or to men as walking after ſin, but ſuch, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſts Death for them, God rebukes and puniſhes. There are <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> that come upon them, as appeares 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29.30. <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.19. Its true, thoſe judgments are not to deſtruction, but that they might be brought to ſee, and confeſs their follies, and turn to the Spirit and Light of God again, which if they do, they ſhall finde the blood of Chriſt then effectual for them to remiſſion again, as it follows in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9 Otherwiſe they ſhall periſh alſo. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.11. And this is the plain meaning and ſcope of that place; which by what is ſaid, appears to be notably miſapplied by Mr. <hi>Owen.</hi> And indeed the not diſcerning of this, is the ground of their error, whom they call <hi>Antinomians,</hi> who deny that God is angry, or puniſhes any believer (or any Elect man though an unbeliever) for his ſin. Its grounded upon, and undeniably flows from this very concluſion of Mr. <hi>Owens,</hi> That for whom Chriſt died, all their ſins are ſatisfied for, paſt preſent, and to come, and God ought not further to moleſt or trouble them for them. Nor can Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> Maintain, what he ſays in <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. againſt the <hi>Socinians,</hi> viz. <q>
                        <hi>That the ſtate of thoſe that Chriſt died for during their unregeneracy, is all one with ſuch as he died not for, that they are unacceptable in all their ſervices, in bondage to Death, yea, under the curſe and condemning power of the Law, obnoxious to judgment, and guilty of eternal Death.</hi>
                     </q> I ſay, theſe things cannot be true of any of them, if Chriſt hath made for all their ſin, ſuch ſatisfaction, as that they ought to be diſcharged of all ſuits, charges, and moleſtations, as here he ſaith they ought. How can it be conceived, That a man whoſe debts are all paid, that he hath or ſhall contract, is liable to the Law, and obnoxious to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual impriſonment ſtill for them. But we ſay, a man whoſe debt is paid, &amp; he diſcharged, may run into a new debt and become obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous again to Law, And that the caſe is ſo here, appears, as by that inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation before noted, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.11. So alſo by many other Scriptures. So the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that were pardoned all their rebellions and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings from <hi>Egypt,</hi> till they ſent Spies to <hi>Canaan,</hi> and that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion too that inſued. <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.19, 20. yet were many of them cut off and conſumed without pardon for the Rebellion of <hi>Korah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> that ſoon after hapned, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. Nor would <hi>Moſes</hi> intercede for them in that, though he hath for all the reſt formerly. <hi>ver.</hi> 15. And accordingly thoſe who are ſaid to have had
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:117749:90"/>their old ſins cleanſed, yet growing purblinde, and Apoſtatizing (for ſo its clearly intimated by way of Antitheſis, that they may fall, yea, are in the way to it, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9, 10.) yea, denying the Lord that bought them, and turning his grace into wantonneſs, are ſaid to periſh in the gainſayings of <hi>Korah,</hi> no pardon for ſo high rebellion, <hi>Jude</hi> 11. Again, as God is <q>
                        <hi>That Creditor to whom</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſaith) <hi>we owe a thouſand talents, Matth.</hi> 18.</q> So our Saviour there tells us, That they who receive forgiveneſs of thoſe talents from him, and yet afterward walk not in the Spirit of God, in love and Chriſtlike diſpoſitions, but forgetting their own purging from their old ſins; are deſtitute of Vertue, Knowledg, Temperance, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> God will ſo deal with them, as he that having forgiven his ſervant a thouſand talents, afterwards for his cruelty to his fellow-ſervant, threw him into Priſon till he ſhould pay the utmoſt far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. So ſays our Saviour himſelf in that very place inſtanced by Mr. <hi>Owen, Matth.</hi> 18.32, 35. So that all Mr. <hi>Owens</hi> Inferences and Queries in that Chapter built upon the former premiſe, are meer fallacies, and amount to juſt nothing. The needs no <hi>Oedipus</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve his Riddles, the Spirit of God in the Scriptures hath plainly enough reſolved them to any that have underſtanding.</p>

But if in his <hi>Major</hi> he means (as he ſeems to do) that he obliged the Father to beſtow upon All for whom he died, and bring them to enjoy all thoſe things which his Death (either as preſented to God, or as believed by us) is ſaid to effect (as his after-enumeration of its effects argue him to mean) then I deny it, and deſire his proof of it, which becauſe he brings not, his Argument falls to the ground, and needs no further anſwering. Onely I ſhall minde the Reader, that the effects enumerated by him, are ſuch (for the moſt part) as it produceth in us by believing on it, ſuch as the <q>

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:117749:91"/>accepted of God they are made known to us, and (withall the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant ratified by it) held forth to us. By letting us ſee ſuch love in God towards us, and ſuch good-will in Chriſt with ſuch perfection to ſave us, and ſo great promiſes ratified to believers, he moves and perſwades us to let go our vain converſations, renounce the world, its fellowſhips, vanities and wickedneſs, to ceaſe cleaving to the earth and earthy men, and having our confidence in them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance on them, for teaching, worſhip, ſatisfaction, delight, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus God is ſaid to have bought <hi>Iſrael</hi> to himſelf, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.6. in that he by ſo great things done for them, purchaſed or gained them in to own and follow him. And ſo in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.2. Gods buying <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be a people for himſelf, is compared to <hi>Hoſeahs</hi> buying an harlot off from other lovers to be his wiſe for a certain conſideration or Sum given her. So Chriſt buys men unto God from other things, by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting before us his great ſufferings for us, and profering to us the great glory he will thereby bring vs to if we will renounce all for him. But this note is over and above what was needful for ſhewing the invalidity of the Argument. All his other quotations too are impertinent, and none of them prove, either that God is obliged by the Death of Chriſt, and ought to grant to, and poſſeſs all for whom he died of thoſe good things that he mentions: or that he was, or is bound thereby (otherwiſe then as he freely ingaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) to do them to any. They ſay, That <hi>by his Death we are recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled,</hi> as we may ſay By <hi>Joabs</hi> Mediation <hi>Abſolom</hi> was recalled from baniſhment and brought into <hi>Davids</hi> favor. Which ſpeech proves not that the inward worth of his Mediation bound <hi>David</hi> to that. So, He is our Propitiatory through Faith in his blood, and God hath ſet him forth to be ſo, that proves not that he obliged God to forgive the ſins of All he died for. The like I might ſay for Peace-making and ſalvation. <hi>Believing on him we are at peace with God, and ſhall be ſaved by him;</hi> but no place ſayes, All that he died for ſhall be ſaved, or that God ought to make them all believe, and ſo ſave them, as was before ſhewed.</p>

                  <p>The firſt is, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between her ſeed and thy ſeed; He ſhall break thy

It ſays, but that the ſeed of the woman, and them that are born of Satan (granting that by the Serpent Satan is meant) ſhall have enmity between themſelves, and the womans ſeed ſhall conquer Satan. How the Elect ſhould be the ſeed of the woman more then others, I finde no reaſon, much leſs proof for it, And how it follows, That if Chriſt brake the head of Satan, then he died not for All, I ſee as little. Again, I finde not that any man, as he is born into the world, is called a childe of Satan, one of the Serpents ſeed. And we have ſhewed, That Chriſt might die for All, as faln in <hi>Adam,</hi> and yet deſtroy all ſuch as after that, and the goodneſs extended to them thereby, ſhould rebel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, though the Verſe ſpeak not of deſtroying any but the Serpent himſelf, <hi>He ſhall break thy head.</hi> So that this Argument concludeth nothing. He neither proving the Serpent to be the Devil (and ſo that the Devil goes upon his belly and eats duſt) nor the ſeed of the woman to be the Elect onely, nor that any till they rebel againſt Chriſt are the ſeed of the Serpent, nor that Chriſt was promiſed to the ſeed of the woman, there is no ſuch paſſage in it, That I will give the womans ſeed one to die for them. At the moſt, it amounts but to this, That Chriſt in himſelf, and thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, ſhall get the better of Satan, and all that do oppoſe them. Which we grant.</p>

                     <q>
                        <hi>I profeſs unto you I never knew you. But Chriſt</hi> (ſays he) <hi>ſaith expreſly, he knows his own whom he died for. Joh.</hi> 10.14, 17. <hi>Surely he knows whom, and what he hath bought,</hi> &amp;c.</q> This is fallacious reaſoning, To ſhew the vanity of which, we are to minde, That to know in Scripture, is ſometime to apprehend, underſtand, or diſcern a thing, what it is, and of what nature. So Chriſt knew what was in man, and knows all things. But oftentimes to know, is to own, approve, and acquaint ones ſelf with: ſo God is ſaid to know the way of the righteous. And in both theſe ſenſes Chriſt (is in ſome meaſure known of his, and he) knows his ſheep. But in the latter ſenſe we ſay, He knows not (that is, approves not of) all he died for. Though buying them they are his own, yet he skils not of many of them in their ſtates and ways, ſo as to own them for his friends, and acquaint himſelf with them, as
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:117749:93"/>the word here ſignifies. Its as much as, You went without my Miſſion, however, without my liking in all your ways. His Argument that He hints thus [<hi>Chriſt knows them He died for. But he knows not All,</hi> Ergo, <hi>Died not for All</hi>] is fallacious, The <hi>Minor</hi> is Negative in the third Figure; and the <hi>Major</hi> a particular Affirmative or a falſity. For we deny (take knowing for owning, approving and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing, as there it ſignifies) that Chriſt ſo knows all that he died for, though he doth his ſheep. Its like this. <hi>Iſrael</hi> that came out of <hi>Egypt</hi> was planted by God in <hi>Canaan,</hi> But all <hi>Iſrael</hi> that paſſed over the red Sea was not ſo planted, <hi>Ergo,</hi> they all came not out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> We grant that Chriſt knew, whom, and what he bought, even all of them, <hi>Simplici cognitione,</hi> as knowledg ſignifies, in the former of the ſenſes above mentioned: But that he owns them all in their way and frame, we deny. Its like this. A Prince ranſoms an hundred ſlaves, ſome of them under pretence of honoring him, do wicked acts to his diſhonor, and then being brought to an account, they plead what they have done to honor him, how they have ſpoken for him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He bids them be gone, for he approved none of their actions, never owned them in what they ſay they did for him, they ſecretly carrying on a Trayterous deſign againſt him: And as ſuch people pleading his ranſoming of them, and the coſt he was at for them, and the pains he took to do them good, would but plead againſt themſelves, and he could eaſily anſwer them, that they were the more ingaged to have loved him, ſought his glory, and ſerved his deſigns, and not to have counterfeited with him, ſecretly ſeeking to betray him, under pretences of love: So will Chriſt

Mark by the way, that its not ſaid, Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect, becauſe Chriſt dyed for them? but, God juſtifies them, &amp; who is he that condemns them? Not, who ſhal condemn them? but who is he (that is in compariſon of God that juſtifies them) that here reproaches and condemns them? Its Chriſt that dyed, one who hath infinite favor with God dyed for them being enemies and ſhall not ſuch a one (being now at his right hand) prevaile for more ſtrength for God to uphold them (they being his choiſe ones, men in him, and believers on him) then is in all their adverſaries to overthrow them?

                     </q> But our Saviour here affirms there are ſuch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Both theſe propoſitions I deny. The firſt, for he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veales it not to children dying in infancy by the outward preaching, yet we dare believe they are not all heirs of hell, and he may juſtly hide the inward revelation from thoſe that ſtop their ears againſt, or attend not to the outward preaching, and yet Chriſt might dy for them to ranſome them from the Death that they were adjudged to in <hi>Adam,</hi> that ſo he might further glorify the Father in his diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations towards them, and diſpoſe of them. Beſides he hath not one patch of Scripture to atteſt that propoſition. Again I deny the <hi>minor,</hi> for Chriſt ſaith not there, that thoſe wiſe and prudent men never heard of the Goſpel in its power. The words are not, I thank thee that thou haſt hid the Goſpel from them, much leſs, that thou will never reveal it to them, But, <hi>Theſe things,</hi> which may be underſtood they way of his Judgments of which he had been ſpeaking <hi>ver.</hi> 20.24. and alſo how mens names are writ in Heaven, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.13-20.21.

Theſe things he hath hid from the wiſe and prudent, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to babes: by babes he means men humbled and emptyed of themſelves, like infants that knowing nothing are docible, and diſpute not againſt what is taught them, but believe it though they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend not what is in it, attending till growing up to perfecter capacity they be able to comprehend the truth of it. By wiſe and prudent men he means them that being ſtrong-parted, men of reaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and learning, do think by reaſon to finde out truth, or to be the meaſure of truth propounded, able to judge of what is ſaid to them, and therefore believe not upon the bare authority of the Maſter as Children and babes do, but meaſuring what God ſays by their reaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and prudence, judge many things to be croſs to reaſon and abſurd, and ſo receive them not. Now theſe men while they thus lift up their wiſdom, and think to comprehend truth in a way of reaſon, they finde fault with truth, overlook, deſpiſe and condemn it, and ſo come not to ſee into the myſterious things of it, which God hath put out of that way of reaſon in which they think to finde it: But men that think not themſelves wiſe, but are willing to learn of, &amp; to be taught of God and his word, and therefore dare not but own and receive his ſayings, and cry to him for light about them, they finde wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and to them he ſhews one thing after another, even the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the kingdom, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.2, 6. thence the neceſſity of mens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming humble as little children, and that they that are wiſe in this world become fools (that is deny their own reaſon and wiſdom, not leaning to it as it objects againſt, and findes abſurdities in the truth of God) that they may be made wiſe. Now though God doth this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his meere good will, yet he doth it alſo as a juſt judgment upon ſome for exalting their reaſon againſt Gods word, as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.13, 15. and alſo to abaſe fleſh, that he that glories may glory in God, and that men might be inſtructed to deny themſelves and ceaſe from their own and other mens wiſdome, becoming as babes in a ſimple belief of Gods ſayings, ſo ſhould they underſtand what now by the juſt will of God is hidden from them. I might apply it by way of Caution to theſe very men who exerciſe not babe-like ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:117749:94"/>in giving credit to Gods word, but exalt and lift up their own underſtanding; they are ſick about queſtions,

Be ſwift to hear, ſlow to ſpeak, be more ready to hear what God ſays, then to exerciſe thy reaſon in objecting againſt God. Yet I will not ſay that Chriſt dyed not for theſe men, that being prudent and full of humane wiſdome, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting that above faith, have the things they diſpute againſt hidden from them; that would be found (as too harſh, ſo) too unjuſt a cenſure. Some of theſe wiſe and prudent, from whom theſe things are hidden, may become babes, and then have them revealed to them. Again we may apply that ſaying to the myſteries of Chriſt revealed to weak deſpiſed men, to be publiſhed by them, and not to the Scribes and Phariſees and wiſe men, that ſo the glory of God might not be obſcured by their Wiſdom, as if that found out or helped for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the propagating of the Goſpel: but even thoſe things though revealed to poor, weak, ſimple men, were not to be concealed by them, but to be divulged to the wiſe and prudent alſo for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion or juſt confuſion if they (when revealed) would not accept or yield up to them, for what he told them ſecretly in the ear, they were bidden to proclaime openly upon the houſe tops. And then Gods chuſing weak ſimple men to be the firſt Teachers, and ſo by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence the firſt underſtanders of the divine truth, doth neither prove that others that were wiſe and prudent, were left deſtitute of the means of ſalvation or operation of the Spirit in them, or much leſs that Chriſt dyed not for them, or for All men, but only, That theſe wiſe and prudent, would they be ſaved, muſt ſtoop to God in em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing the knowledge of his mind, by weak and ſorry men; and that indeed is the Genuine meaning as I conceive of that Scripture. Whenas God, had he pleaſed, might have opened his myſteries to the Learned Rabbies, Scribes and Phariſees, to have been divulged by them, he pleaſed to hide them from them, putting them beſide their way, and to reveal them to others, poor ſimple men, by whom they were to be preached to them and to All Nations, and

He ſaith not, For the Children of God, much leſs for the Children of God only; but ſhews that that was one end of his Death reaching further then the Nation, namely to gather the ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Jews, or to bring all that ſhould believe, into an unity of faith and priviledges by ſlaying the enmity (the Law of ordinances) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them: this puts no limitation to the Death of Chriſt, nor ſaith that any were excluded it.</p>
                  <p>His next is <hi>Rom.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Scrip.</hi> 5.</note> 8.32, 33, 34. which (indeed) is brought as a conſolation to believers in affliction, aſſuring them they have God to juſtify them, and he greater then any againſt them to condemn them; and then they have Chriſt to intercede for them, who had alſo dyed and riſen, and he would not faile them, it being his buſineſs to preſent believers and walkers in the Spirit perfect before him, as we noted before: he that had given his Son for them, would ſurely ſupply them with all ſtrength, them that were the called of God and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in him. <q>Now whereas Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> obſerves, that <hi>this act of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:117749:95"/>giving Chriſt to dy for them, was the greateſt expreſſion of Gods love toward believers.</hi>
                     </q> I anſwer, That the Apoſtle couples two acts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether there. 1. His giving Chriſt for them, that expreſly. 2. His giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to them, thats intimated in that repetition <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, with him; for God gave not all things to be crucified with Chriſt, nor did he give Chriſt to believers or to any in his beating him, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him up to Death and judgement, and Chriſt gave up himſelf to bear the wrath of God, but as one dead and riſen, God gives him with his excellencies to men. Yea this is ſaid to be done to the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, unbelieving Jews, who not receiving him, deprived them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of that life, and all thoſe glorious things in and with him. But to go on with Mr. <hi>Owens</hi> obſervation. He infers from that, thus, <q>
                        <hi>If God gave his Son to dy for All, then he had as great an act of love, and made as great a manifeſtation of it to them that periſh, as to them that are ſaved.</hi>
                     </q> But this follows not, for though in it ſelf it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great, yea compared ſingly with other acts as to the outward expreſſion, the greateſt act of love to give Chriſt to dy for men, yet in regard of the heart of God in it, and the conjoying that act with others, he manifeſted not, nor acted ſo great love to them that periſh, as to them that are ſaved. 1. I ſay, in regard of the heart of God, for in <hi>chap.</hi> 8. Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> tels us, Gods love is his <hi>velle bonum creaturis,</hi> his purpoſe and will of grace; which if ſo, then thats to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the greateſt to them, to whom he purpoſed the greateſt good by that act, which was but the <hi>medium</hi> of good to men. Now in as much as he purpoſed more grace to ſome through that gift then to others, to the ſaved then to thoſe that periſh, though in the <hi>medium</hi> they all ſhared, yet it cannot be ſaid that he manifeſted, or acted as much love to one as to another: To illuſtrate it take this compariſon, <hi>David</hi> put his life in hazzard from the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> when he fought with the Philiſtin, in that he laid his life down at the ſtake as it were,
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 19.5.</note> and it was the greateſt act of love he could have ſhewed to his friend to lay down his life for him, yet in this act he might love his Father with a more intenſe love then many others of them; yet he hazzarded his life for them all, and ſhewed forth that act of love to them all that in expreſſion is higheſt. 2. In reſpect of other acts. Though that act was greater then any other act of love (I ſay ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that) yet not ſo great as that and other acts alſo joyned with it. He loved believers with that and diverſe others, as in compelling them in, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. Yea ſuppoſe all loved alike in that, yet if ſome
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:117749:96"/>of them all ſo alike loved, requiting that his ſame like-love worſe then others,
<note place="margin">As Hoſea, 9.15.</note> are left, and he takes their ſlighing his ſo great love ſo ill, that he will love them no more: And others not ſo requiting him, but accepting it, continue in his love (as the phraſe is <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.10.) and he ſaves them, ſhall we ſay he loves not theſe more then the other? If <hi>David</hi> venture his life for All the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> alike, and after that he coming to have Power and Government, one is by that knit to him and loves him again, as <hi>Jonathan</hi> did, and he enters into Covenant with him to be his choiſe friend; and another regards him not for this, but churliſhly requites him, as <hi>Nabal</hi> did, and for that he deſtroyes him; ſhall we ſay now That <hi>David</hi> loved <hi>Nabal</hi> as much as <hi>Jonathan,</hi> becauſe he acted the ſame higheſt act of love for them both formerly? would not that be a notorious falſhood? And is not this then a notorious fallacy in Mr. <hi>Owen?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. He infers, <hi>That for whomſoever he hath given his Son, to them "alſo he will aſſuredly freely give all things.</hi> But I deny, that the Apoſtle ſayes any ſuch thing. But thus. <hi>That having given his Son for us all, he will ſurely give us all things with him. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s,</hi> that is, ſuch as believe on him; <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s,</hi> that are in Chriſt, that are called according to purpoſe, <hi>&amp;c. Jonathan,</hi> or <hi>Abigal</hi> making this Inference, If <hi>David</hi> ſpared not himſelf, but put his life in his hand for us all, when we were ſtrangers to him, will not he that had ſo much love to us then, give us (<hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s,</hi> his federates and dear friends) with himſelf (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving alſo given himſelf to us by Covenant) whatever is in his power to the half of his Kingdom? Will it follow from ſuch a ſpeech that Therefore whomſoever <hi>David</hi> loved ſo well as to venture his life for them againſt the Philiſtin, to them he will give any good thing thats deſirable of him, yea, though many of them are his arch-enemies, and do rebel againſt him? Who ſees not this to be a falſe Inference? and yet ſuch is this of Mr. <hi>Owens.</hi> The believer doth, or may expect all good things from Chriſt that died for them (even upon that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration that he died for them,) and ſhall have them; therefore whoſoever he died for, ſhall have all good things too. Thence alſo that Faith is not in the number of that All things ſpoken of, appears, becauſe the parties thus ſpeaking, and of whom this is ſpoken, are actuall believers before the making of this Inference. That con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception is like this, He that was at ſuch coſt, as to make a great Feaſt for us (who are brought in to it already, and are at it with thankful acceptance) how ſhall he not give <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s</hi> to eat any dainty that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:117749:96"/>therefore its from this ſpeech inferable, That he that was at ſuch coſt to make ſuch a feaſt, will make all that he invited, to come and eat every dainty of it. Whereas he ſaith, <q>
                        <hi>His deſcription of thoſe perſons there ſpoken of to be Elect, not All, but thoſe choſen in Chriſt before the foundation of the world, confirms the reſtraint of the Death of Chriſt to them alone.</hi>
                     </q> 1. He proves not, nor I am perſwaded can he, That any man yet uncalled hath that denomination of Elect in Scripture. 2. We may ſee the vanity of his Argument by this inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Similitude. <hi>David</hi> venturing his life, and conquering the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtin,</hi> and obtaining the Kingdom, Shall he not ſtand by his friends, familiars and kindred? He that did that for them, when mean, will he ſuffer any enemy to vex and ſpoil them being inveſted with the power of the Kingdom? <hi>Ergo, David</hi> hazarded his life, onely for his friends, familiars, and kindred, and not for any that were his enemies, or that afterward dealt injuriouſly and rebelliouſly againſt him. Is this a good inference, The Elect of God (be they what they will) ſhall be preſerved by the Death, Reſurrection, and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Chriſt from perdition (which is all the Apoſtle there ſays, he ſayes not they are the adequate object of Chriſts Death) There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt died for no more then they, nor deſired any good thing to be granted to any other, but to them? Who that underſtands Reaſon would not hiſs out ſuch arguments? So from theſe words of the Apoſtle concerning the Elect; <hi>Who is he that condemns, its Chriſt that died;</hi> doth this Inference fairly follow? That whoſoever he died for ſhall not be condemned? more then from this; If <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid's</hi> brother, or good Subjects had ſaid, Who is he that accuſes us? Its <hi>David</hi> the King that ventured his life for our good, and now raings to defend us from harm, it would follow, <hi>Ergo,</hi> None that he ventured his life for againſt <hi>Goliah,</hi> ſhall be put to death for any after-carriage toward him. It doth but undeniably appear to me from all this, that Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> underſtands not the drift of the Apoſtle, nor ſees the maner of his reaſoning; but no whit evident, That Chriſt died onely for the Elect, as he ſayes.</p>
                  <p>He next Allegation is, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1 7. <hi>We have redemption in him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Scrip.</hi> 6.</note> That is ſtill, we that are brought to him, made accepted in him, tranſlated into his Kingdom (as <hi>Col.</hi> 1.14. and as himſelf grants in his Chapter againſt the <hi>Socinians,</hi> where he denies any of the Elect to be freed from wrath till regenerate) we have (that is, injoy or poſſeſs) Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, that is, remiſſion of our ſins, clearing &amp; freeing us from all
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:117749:97"/>our bonds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore all that he died for, or; Therefore he died onely for us. Is this right reaſoning? put it into form and then judg of it; its thus. If the believer hath redemption in Chriſt, Then all that he died for, But the believer hath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I deny the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of his <hi>Major</hi> Propoſition, and leave him to prove it. And it in what ſenſe All have releaſe, and in what not, we have ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. There is redemption in Chriſt for All to ſeek after, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion with him, preached or predicable to all, that they might look after it, but, All for whom he died, I ſay, have it not, that is, have not received it, and ſo injoy it not. How alſo they may be (comparatively to what their caſe ſhould have been) bleſſed, and how not bleſſed, in that ſenſe ſpoken of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6, 7. we have ſhewed in <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p>His next is,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Scrip.</hi> 7.</note> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>He made him to be ſin for us, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> that is, in believing on him. Thence he infers, All that He was made ſin for, are made the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God in him. Its like that, He brought them into <hi>Canaan</hi> that they might keep his Statutes, <hi>Ergo,</hi> All that were brought into <hi>Canaan</hi> kept his Statutes; as we noted at the beginning. So <hi>by his ſtripes we</hi> (we believers) <hi>are healed, Ergo,</hi> All that he died for, ſhall, though they never ſubmit to have the playſter applied. <hi>David</hi> by hazzard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his life brought us his friends to honor, <hi>Ergo,</hi> He ventured his life for no more but them that come to honor. As weak is that from <hi>Joh.</hi> 15, 13. "<hi>Greater love than this hath no man:</hi> If he acted the greateſt, Why not all the reſt? In which there is nothing but Reaſon exalting it ſelf againſt the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>David</hi> put his life in his hand for All <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Why, ſeeing that was the greateſt act of love a man could ſhew, did he not do all other acts of love to them all as to <hi>Jonathan?</hi> Again, This This life is more then food, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.25. Why then doth God ſuffer any to periſh for want of food, which is the leſs, ſeeing he hath given them life which is the greater? Why doth he not inrich and furniſh them to the utmoſt?

This is anſwered before, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 2, 3, 5.

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:117749:97"/>of them to be his ſervants, whom he makes his Favorites, and imploys them to negotiate for him with the reſt, that they alſo might become his ſervants and finde favor. Being about to leave that Country, and go a far journey; he commits them to his Father, and intreats him to have a ſpecial care of them his Servants and Favorites, admit them at all times into his preſence, make them acquainted with his counſels, aſſiſt them in their work againſt all Oppoſers, And tells him in his requeſt making, he asks not thoſe things for the Rebels yet ſtanding out, but for thoſe reconciled ones for whom in ſpecial he ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf apart to make this requeſt, and yet intreats him alſo, That whoever of the Rebels yet in Arms ſhall by their miniſtration be won in to like affection and ſervice to him, they might finde like reſpect from him as they, <hi>Ergo.</hi> This Prince procured not the former pardon for all the Rebels, or did not reſcue them from the death they were going to. <hi>A baculo ad Angulum.</hi> Such alſo is his laſt.</p>
                  <p>His laſt is, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 5.25. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. <hi>Chriſt loved the Church,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Scrip.</hi> 9.10.</note> and gave himſelf for it, Ergo,</hi> Chriſt died not for all. <hi>David</hi> fought with the <hi>Philiſtin,</hi> and expoſed his life to danger for his friends and Fathers Houſe (ſuppoſe) to bring them to honor. <hi>Ergo,</hi> He did it not at all for All <hi>Iſrael.</hi> The Church, People called, are properly the object of Chriſts care, to be waſhed and preſented glorious, as a fit Bride for himſelf, <hi>Ergo,</hi> He loved, he died for no more. Its like this. A mans wife is properly the object of his Conjugal affection, <hi>Ergo,</hi> A man may love none but his wife with a love of charity. The brazen Serpent was to heal no more then looked up to it, Therefore it was provided for none to look to, but them that did look to it, and were healed. Such are Mr. <hi>Owens</hi> Inferences. Chriſt eyed ſuch as were to be given him of the Father, as a people that would ſtand in need of much healing and waſhing; and provided in his Death, that ſuch ſhould have what ever tends to their perfection, <hi>Ergo,</hi> he laid down his life for no more to ranſom them and ſet them at liberty to ſeek after him. A Prince ranſoming a thouſand priſoners, makes it in his bargain, that all of them that ſubmit to him, upon view of this act, ſhould be made Courtiers, Onely fifty of them ſubmit, and are made ſo, <hi>Ergo,</hi> he ranſomed no more out of Priſon. Such Arguments as theſe are ſcarce worth ſo much time and labor as to anſwer.

And whereas he thought to have added more, He did better as he did, except they had more force in them.

                        <hi>The innate Sufficiency of the death of Chriſt, That the death of Chriſt is ſufficient for the Redemption of the whole world, for the expiation of all the ſins of All and every man in the world, and that ariſing from the dignity of his perſon, &amp; the greatneſs of the pains that he ſuffered, he undergoing the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:117749:99"/>whole curſe of the Law and wrath of God due to ſin. This</hi> (he ſays) <hi>is its own Internall worth</hi> (which I will not deny) but then he adds that, <hi>Its being a price for any, and being beneficiall to them according to the worth that is in it, ariſes not from that, but is meerly Externall, and depends upon the Intention and Will of God: The intention of the offerer and accepter that it ſhould be for ſuch ſome, or any.</hi>
                     </q> All which I will grant him alſo. But thence he comes to view the Diſtinction uſed by ſome Proteſtant Divines, <q>
                        <hi>Of his Dying for All</hi> Sufficienter <hi>but not</hi> Efficaciter,</q> 
                     <hi>in regard of the</hi> Sufficiency <hi>of the Ranſome he paid, but not in regard of the Efficacy of its Application;</hi> which he denies, except in this ſenſe, <q>
                        <hi>That it was ſufficient to have been made a Price for All, but it was not a ſufficient price and ranſom for All,</hi>
                     </q> not becauſe not ſufficient, but becauſe not a Ranſome. In which he ſpeaks,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Improperly, as to his own intention, for that it was a Ranſome, is as undoubtedly a Truth, as that it had an innate ſufficiency for All, but he ſhould have ſaid (had he ſpoken rightly to his own meaning) not becauſe not ſufficient, but becauſe not intended for All as a Ranſome.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Untruly, and ſo as he overthrows that diſtinction, for that which was not done at all for All, was not ſufficiently done for All. Now I on the contrary affirm, That it was ſufficiently indured for All, yea as a ranſome, yea and ſo effectuall with God too for All, that he inflicts not upon All, what juſtice exacted according to the ſentence gone out upon <hi>Adam</hi> and All in him; had he dealt with All men according to that word, He and all in him had that day periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and been cut off for ever: but Chriſt interpoſing, made All things to conſiſt, and upheld the pillars of the earth, which elſe were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved. Yea God deals mercifully and bountifully with All, and diſpenſes of his goodneſs to All, quite contrary to the Demerit of All in that ſin. And further he hath done for All ſo ſufficiently in his Death, that He is a meet object for All to believe on, and hope in, and (eſpecially where the Goſpel-proclamation comes) its great unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and iniquity in men, not to depend on him, live to, and ſerve him; even as great or greater then it was for the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> brought wonderouſly out of Egypt, not to believe Gods word for bringing them to <hi>Canaan.</hi> He hath done ſo much for All and every man, that he is worthy they ſhould look up to him, and able in ſo doing to ſave them without renewing his ſufferings, or making a new bargain about them for them.</p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:117749:99"/>
                  <p>His inferences from that firſt premiſe I ſhall view alſo: they are</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That he conceives,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Infer.</hi> 1.</note> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>That the Aſſertors of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſall Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, do much undervalue the infinite value and worth of the Death of Chriſt,</hi>
                     </q> which I deny, and challenge him to make it good againſt us, which he aſſays, <q>
                        <hi>By telling us that we Affirm that a door of grace was opened by it for ſinners, but deny that any were effectually carryed in at the door by it.</hi>
                     </q> Which 1. Is a falſe impoſition, for we affirm that the ſight and diſcovery of this hath ſuch vertue in it, that it effectually pulls in many at the door, reconciles, waſhes, begets to hope, &amp;c. Yea this is the proper or ordinary way of Gods bringing in men effectually; to glorify his Son in theſe his ſufferings and ſacrifice to them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Suppoſe we ſhould ſay he obliged not God by his Death to bring in any at All; yet it will not thence follow that we extenuate the value and worth of the ſacrifice of Chriſt. If Mr. <hi>Owens</hi> principle be true it ſalves that, for he ſays, <q>
                        <hi>Its being a price for this or that man (ſure then by conſequence too for this or that thing) ariſeth not from its inward worth, but is meerly externall to that, ariſing ſolely from the Intention of the offerer and accepter,</hi>
                     </q> that is, from the mutual part or Covenant agreed upon between them. Therefore if it was not agreed upon by Chriſt and God, that God ſhould bring in this or that man, or any at all to believe in him, it would be no diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vertue of it, that being not hereby to be meaſured. No, ſhould we ſay any of, or All thoſe things that he imputeth to the <hi>Arminians,</hi> viz. <q>

                     </q> yet ſuppoſing that ſuch had been the Covenant between God and Chriſt (as doubtleſs they do ſuppoſe ſo, that ſo expreſs themſelves) by Mr. <hi>Owens</hi> own principle before laid down, we ſhould be acquitted of diſhonoring or undervaluing the Death of Chriſt therein; that not being the Meaſure of its worth, what he purchaſed by it, but what the dignity of his perſon and greatneſs of his ſufferings. The things purchaſed being only according to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement between God and Chriſt, not the ſufficiency of his Death to have purchaſed by it. Such expreſſions may not rightly declare the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:117749:100"/>agreement between God and Chriſt about the end of his ſufferings, but no way deny the inward worth of them by his principles, from which this is wondrouſly inconſequently inferred.</p>

                     <q>
                        <hi>That the innate vertue and ſufficiency it hath, is a foundation to the generall preaching of the Goſpel to All Nations, and of the right that it hath to be preached to every creature, becauſe the way to ſalvation it declares is wide enough for all to walke in.</hi>
                     </q> How that ſhould be a foundation for that, I ſee not, more then the paying for ten priſoners in a thouſand, ten times as much to ranſome them, as might have ſufficed to have ranſomed them all, but yet excluding in the bargain All but ten, is a good foundation to go tell all thoſe thouſand that there is very good news for them All; ther's as much paid for ten of them, as would have ranſomed them All ten times over but 990. of them were excluded the bargain, yet good ground to bid every one of them look for freedom by it. Sure its not the wideneſs of the way that is ground enough to tell All, that there is good news for them, but the liberty that they may have to walk in it. The Truth is that Doctrine not only makes the Goſpel needleſs to be preached to All, but needleſs alſo to be preached at All, ſeeing none for whom Chriſt dyed can poſſibly miſs of life, by their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, All their ſins paſt preſent and to come being ſatisfied for, and of due to be diſcharged, ſhould they hear nothing at all. But he infers further.</p>

                     <q>
                        <hi>That inward ſufficiency in it ſelf (made inſufficient to the moſt by that excluſive intention) is a good ground to call all men every where to Repent and to believe.</hi>
                     </q> I wonder what ground that can be for that. Sure as much as the telling a thouſand priſoners That one had paid as much for the ranſome of ten of them, as would have ſufficed for the ranſoming ten times ſo many as they all are, is a good ground to call upon them All to have good thoughts of him that gave the ranſome for them ſome, to be ſorry for their faults againſt him, and to be broken at the hearſay of his love to them, and expect every one of them to be ſet at liberty by vertue of that Ranſome. I pray what greater ground ſhould a thouſand men have, All to look for deliverance, becauſe of the payment of ſo much for ſo few, more then if they ſhould hear that he had paid only ſo much as would ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to ranſome them few. How can we exhort All to admire and be affected with Gods love to them, mourn for their follies againſt ſuch a lover of them, love him for his love, and hope that he by
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:117749:100"/>vertue of Chriſts Death will fully ſave them, if we cannot ſay by the word of God (which is only meet to beget divine faith) that Chriſt hath dyed for half, nay for any of them (for ſuch may be the caſe for ought any of them know of their whole Congregation) Is our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane conjectures and peradventures that ſuch and ſuch a one may be of that Number, ground enough to bid men affect, and love, and hope in God, as one that hath loved them? Or do we ſpeak of Faith and Repentance, neither ſpringing from Love believed, nor accompanied with love to God in our hearts? Sure ſuch Faith and Repentance are not thoſe the Scriptures call for. Or can we expect that the telling men of its infinite ſufficiency will beget hope in them, more then if it were onely ſufficient for them for whom it was intended, whenas they are told they are never the more included in its intendment by vertue of its infinite ſufficiency, then if it was far leſs ſufficient? VVe may, its true, aſſure men of ſalvation if they be believers, or do believe, but can we (upon that ground) aſſure any one of good ground for their believing, or that Chriſt is an object meet for them to believe on, that he is appointed as a Mediator for them, or is able to ſave them? For can we ſay he is able to ſave any more then thoſe that were included in his intention? If he ſhould ſave any more, he muſt make a new bargain for them, and pay a new price for their ſalvation. VVhat is this better then Law-preaching, to ſay, If thou believeſt thou ſhalt be ſaved? The Law promiſes life to thoſe that keep it, but affords not motive and ſpirit to effect what it requireth. So doth their Doctrine promiſe life upon Faith, but gives no ſtraw, affords no certain object that ſuch or ſuch have cauſe to believe on him, demonſtrates no love to the ſoul to draw it in to believe, for thats uncertain, ſuch Preachers give but an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſound, that cannot affirm, that the VVord of God ſaith, That there is any thing done by Chriſt for any one man in their Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, that may evidence it a juſt and right thing for him to hope in God for ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>But he tells us, That when God calls upon men to believe, he doth not in the firſt place call upon them to believe that Chriſt died for them, but that there is no name under heaven whereby they may be ſaved, but only of Jeſus Chriſt</hi>
                     </q> Well, and is there not an intimation in that that Chriſt died for them? Sure he that excepts the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, intimates he hath a Name by which they may. And
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:117749:101"/>what is that? <hi>Name,</hi> Either ſignifies Power and Authority, or the report and fame that goes on him. Now he that leaves it uncertain, whether Chriſt died ſufficiently for them (as he confeſſedly doth that leaves it uncertain whether Chriſt hath died for them) leaves it alſo uncertain, whether Chriſt hath power by his death to ſave them. Nor can they fame him to be one able and ready to ſave them; and ſo they cannot preach, that there is a Name of Jeſus by which they may be ſaved. So that the proof he brings, overthrows the Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which it is brought to prove. Can men be called on to believe in God, and not through a Mediator? And can they look through a Mediator on him, when they know not of any they have? He then that calls upon me to believe through Chriſts Mediation (as who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever calls upon men rightly to believe muſt do) doth intimate, that there is ſomething in his Mediation for me to be incouraged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in God by, and ſo by conſequence, that he died for me; elſe (be the merit of it never ſo great) its no ground of Faith to me. And ſurely, however Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> determins, God hath no where ſo deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, nor the Apoſtles ſo Preached. One tells us, That the <hi>Record</hi> of God (which he that believes not makes God a lyer) is this, <hi>That God hath given us eternal life,</hi> and this life is in his Son, <hi>He that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son hath not life,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.10, 11, 12. And ſurely this is the onely full ground of drawing men to the Son, when they are told by the VVord of God, that God hath given them life in his Son, and the way to have it, is to have him, but rejecting him, and not coming to him for life, they reject life, and deprive themſelves of what God hath given them. He that believes not this in every part of it when declared, makes God a lyer; and will not, nor can come in to him to believe on Chriſt. If he believe not that God hath given him life, then will he either deſpaire, or ſeek it by Works, and not by Faith; if not that this life is in Chriſt, then will he not look to Chriſt for it, or believe on him. If he think he may have it and not have Chriſt, and have Chriſt or not have it, then will he neglect believing on Chriſt as a thing unneceſſary, or unprofitable for him. So <hi>Peter</hi> tells the people, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.23. God ſent Chriſt to turn every one of you from your iniquities. And <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 13.37. tells them, that Remiſſion of ſins was Preached to them in Chriſts name, both equivalent to Chriſts Mediating, and dying for them, and coming for their ſakes. And ſo in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. and <hi>Matt.</hi> 224.9. The Declaration of Gods good will to them
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:117749:101"/>is laid down as the ground of exhorting them to come in to God. And to ſay no more, See what the teſtimony is, of which God made the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> an Apoſtle, and Teacher of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in Faith and Verity. Is it not that in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>God would have all men to be ſaved and come to the knowledg of the Truth, for there is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Chriſt Jeſus, who gave himſelf a Ranſom for All?</hi> And the appearance of the love of God to man, was it that brought <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf in, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.4, 5. Was it ever found that a man was called by God to truſt in that that he never ſet up for him to truſt in! to ſtay upon Chriſts blood, and Chriſt ſhed none for him? So that I hope by this, the vanity of Mr. <hi>Owens</hi> Inferences from his firſt premiſe appears, and that his underſtanding of the Diſtinction of <hi>Sufficiency,</hi> and <hi>Efficiency,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Conſideration of the dignity of the Sacrifice of Chriſt, in regard as of his perſon, ſo of the greatneſs of his pains, holds forth onely this to us, That God, to make his Sons ſufferings more valuable then needed to be for the bargain intended, put him to more pains then he needed to have endured, which is a piece of blaſphemy. But I paſs from that Conſideration.</p>

<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Conſid.</hi> 3.</note> That we muſt diſtinguiſh between mans duty and Gods purpoſe. Thats true, God doth not alwaies purpoſe to make us do what we ought to do, or effect what he wils us to do. Nor do we confound theſe two, nor ſay that God pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to make all to believe that he bids to believe (whether they liſten to him or not) or ſave all that he bids look up to him and be ſaved (whether they look to him or not) but we would fain have Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſhew us that God ever bids any man attend upon an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance that was not provided for him, and puniſhed any for not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending on what was not ordained for them to attend to, that he bids any believe in Chriſt, for whom he did not ſend Chriſt; bid any believe in his blood, for whom he ſhed no blood. As we diſtinguiſh between the precept and purpoſe of God, ſo do we alſo between the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:117749:102"/>foundation of the precept and his purpoſe; and affirm that God bids not men to attend to him for Good, where he hath not appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them ſome <hi>medium</hi> in attendance to him, in which they might have good. He bid none look to the brazen Serpent for whom he had not ſet it up, nor puniſhed any ſuch for not looking to it. So that for his after-inference, I ſhall only put this to Mr. <hi>Owen,</hi> to ſhew that it is acceptable to God, and the duty of man, that any man for whom Chriſt dyed not, and for whom God ſent him not, ſhould believe and ſtay upon his Mediation, or approach to God by him; that thoſe men whom Chriſt excluded his Mediation, as much as he did the Devills, have any more duty lying upon them to believe in Chriſt, then the Divels have, or that they ſhould in ſo doing be any whit more acceptable unto God.

                        <hi>That the Jews had an ingraffed erronious perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that the ſalvation or deliverance of the</hi> Meſſias <hi>or promiſed ſeed, belonged only to themſelves who were the off-ſpring of</hi> Abraham <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fleſh,</hi>
                     </q> which is alſo untrue; they ever held and believed that any people of any other Nations being converted and proſely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them were capable of fellowſhip with them in their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and bleſſings, and thence they endeavoured to make many proſelytes, which had been bootleſs, had they thought by ſo doing they ſhould yet have had no ſhare in their bleſſings; the reſt, its true, that remained unproſelyted, were looked upon as Dogs; but any man, though not of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, yet by Circumciſion, and being proſelyted, did grow into one body with them. Thence the falſe Apoſtles, zealous of the Law and honor of the Jewiſh Nation, did not plead againſt Gentiles coming to their priviledges, but that as Gentiles and Uncircumciſed they ſhould be ſo admitted: that was their great ſtumble, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 11.3. <hi>Thou wenteſt into men uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, and didſt eat with them,</hi> and Chap. 15.2. <hi>Except ye be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed and keep the Law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>ye cannot be ſaved,</hi> but to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelyted Gentiles, as well as to the Jews of the fleſh of <hi>Abraham</hi> they preached from the beginning without ſcruple, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. Peter <hi>and the reſt preached to peoples of all Nations round about that were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo in <hi>Acts.</hi> 6.1, 2. <hi>Their Church conſiſted of Jews and Grecians.</hi> Not that, but this was the Myſterie, that the Gentiles being yet ſuch, uncircumciſed in the fleſh, ſhould be made fellow-heirs
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:117749:103"/>of the ſame body, and partakers of the promiſes of Chriſt: But he tels us, <q>
                        <hi>That this taking in of the Gentiles gave occaſion to many generall expreſſions,</hi>
                     </q> which we have granted before: But that therefore the words, All men, World, Whole world, ſignifie only the people of God ſcattered throughout the Whole World, I deny, and deſire Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> to prove, ſeeing thoſe expreſſions of All that fear God, Jew and Gentile, All that believe, Jew and Gentile, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were ſufficient for that purpoſe, expreſſions uſed frequently when the Apoſtles ſpeak of the participation of the ſpeciall benefits that come by Chriſts Death, as ſalvation, acceptation to favor the promiſes of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in which caſes the words All men, the World, the Whole world, are never uſed. Its never ſaid the Whole world is accepted of God, All men ſhall be ſaved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet in thoſe caſes there are ſuch words uſed as exclude all limitations of thoſe things to the Jews. In every Nation he that fears God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All that call upon the name of the Lord: Whoſoever believes, Jew or Gentile. And had that been all the reaſon of the Apoſtles uſing generall expreſſions, and had it been his intention in them to include none but the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, thoſe expreſſions had been large enough, and apter for that buſineſs, affording no occaſion of miſconception or contention; therefore we conclude, that ſeeing they had and uſed other words to include all that are the ſubject of Gods promiſes in Chriſt, which included but them, and all of them of all Nations, they had ſome further reaſon in uſing theſe larger expreſſions, of All, Every one, the Whole world, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the buſineſs of the Death of Chriſt and the Goſpel preaching, eſpecially, ſeeing they uſe not thoſe largeſt words in affirming the injoyment of Eternall life and ſalvation to men, which yet are injoyed, as far as Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> would extend their ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Beſide, what made the uſe of thoſe large expreſſions to the Gentile Churches for rooting out of the Jews that foreſaid opinion? and yet to the Gentile Churches he moſt frequently uſes it; or what did that make to perſwade the Eunuch or Gentile to take hold of the Covenant when he uſes them to thoſe that had taken hold of it already? beſides, would not thoſe other expreſſions of Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord, Jew or Gentile, or Whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, Jew or Gentile, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have ſufficed to thoſe purpoſes that Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> pretendeth. So that this gives not light into the ſenſe of thoſe words, All, and Whole World, uſed by the Apoſtles in this buſineſs of Redemption. Nor proves he them to hold forth a generall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:117749:103"/>only into men of All ſorts (which the other phraſes more cleerly do) and not a collective Univerſality. That in <hi>John</hi> 11.52. we have anſwered before, and it fals into the number of thoſe places, that ſpeaking of the injoyment of the ſpeciall priviledges of the Saints (ſuch as Union together in priviledges muſt needs include) uſe not a Generall or Univerſall expreſſion, but a Generall qualified expreſſion. This was one end of Chriſts Death, That all the Children of God in all Nations, that is, all believers ſhould be made one in priviledge, but it anſwers not thoſe expreſſions that ſay, he dyed for All and Every one.

And its ſaid many of thoſe that profeſs Gods name in the latter dayes (even of the Gentiles) ſhall be fooliſh Virgins, even at that time, and of them Sathan ſhall deceive multitudes and gather them to battell againſt the holy city. So that more ſhall turn unto the Lord, then prove through-believers; The other places of <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16, &amp; 6.33, 51. we deny to be taken in that ſenſe, except we ſhould read <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. thus, God ſo loved the Elect, or the good or better part of the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth ſhould not periſh, which to me ſeems non-ſenſe, the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, whoever believeth, having the force of a diſtributive or partitive to the word World, otherwiſe it had been proper to have ſaid, that they or it believing ſhould not periſh, or that it ſhould believe and not periſh. In <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.33, 51. &amp; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. we ſay he begs the queſtion, and brings no ground that confirms his ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we ſhall refer the further conſideration of them to due place. That in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.12. is very impertinent, for it makes the words of the Apoſtle to ſound thus, that the promiſe was made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to all the people of God (for thats the force of the word, his ſeed there) that they ſhould be heirs of all the people of God; which is a piece of non-ſenſe. We ſay that the word World there, ſignifies <hi>Mundum Continentem,</hi> not only the inhabitants, but all the things of the World, as in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21, 22. All things are yours, the world <hi>&amp;c.</hi> chiefly the world to come, The world, as heaven and earth and all things ſhall be made new. That in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.12, 15. is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent too, and untruly alledged in that ſenſe. The <hi>Words, Riches,</hi> and <hi>Reconciliation,</hi> ſignify but the way or means to inrich and reconcile; for that the fall of the Jews was not the formall riches and reconciliation of the world,
<note place="margin">Upon Ro. 11.15.</note> is as clear as the noon-light, but that was the occaſionall way of inriching and reconciling the World, not only the Elect and Godly, but the reſt, though many by reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the riches of Chriſt preached amongſt, and the word of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation preached to them, with the grace therein tendred, were not
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:117749:104"/>actually inriched with the riches proper to the Saints, and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in their hearts. As wholſom Laws and good Government are the hapineſs of a Nation, that is, the way and means of making a Nation in general happy, though many by their evil-bearing them, and rebelling againſt them, ſhould actually pull down miſchief upon their own heads: So the goodneſs of God extended to men in the Goſpel and Ordinances of God, is a Table to them, though they by their unbelief turn it into a ſnare, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.22. and is a mercy to men in general, though many by obſerving lying vanities, put away their own mercy from them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.8. That place in <hi>Col.</hi> 1.6. Evidently ſignifies, <hi>Mundum continentem,</hi> place, not perſons. Thence the change of the phraſe. Its come to you, as alſo in all the world, He ſaith, Not to you and to All the world. In the <hi>World,</hi> ſignifies Place; To the <hi>World</hi> had ſignified <hi>Perſons:</hi> The Goſpel is Preached in the world to men. That in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.2. We deny to ſignify the godly onely, we ſhall view his proofs for it when we come at them. I might ſhew alſo ſome beg'd, preſumed, and proofleſs Applications of divers Scriptures quoted by him, to ſhew that the word <hi>World</hi> ſignifies men rejected, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.19. and 17.25. with ſome others, which in their expreſſions might have been applied to <hi>Saul,</hi> and many perſecuters of Chriſt that were after converted, but I paſs them, with divers other things leſs pertinent. VVhat he promiſes upon this Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we ſhall ſpeak to when we meet it. Whereas he further notes, <q>1. <hi>That there is often in Scripture an <gap reason="foreign">

                     </q> We grant it, but his Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it to <hi>John</hi> 3.17. as concerning the different ſignifications of the word <hi>World</hi> in thoſe two phraſes, <hi>Not to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be ſaved,</hi> we ſay is begged, and deſire any one clear proof that any believer, or number of believers living in the world, are called the <hi>world, The preſent world.</hi> He notes, <q>2. <hi>That no Argument can be taken from a phraſe of ſpeech in the Scripture in any particular place, if in other places thereof where it is uſed, the ſignification preſſed from that place is evidently denied, unleſs the ſcope of the place, or ſubject matter of it do inforce it.</hi>
                     </q> This we conſeſs, as to Argument, though to Faith a place may be ſufficient where the Argument will not inforce it by this rule. As to Inſtance. <hi>All that are in their graves ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God, and ſhall come forth, ſome to the reſurrection of life, and ſome to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:117749:105"/>the reſurrection of condemnation.</hi> By his Rule we cannot conclude, That All, and Every man ſhall ariſe out of their graves, becauſe the word <hi>All</hi> is taken in many places but for the generality of men, not for every individual. <hi>As All men ſeek their own,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore from the word <hi>All</hi> we cannot inforce that ſignification. Again, The ſcope of the place will not inforce it, for its independent to the preceding Verſes, except in this, that therein Chriſt aſſerts his glorious Power and Authority fore-ſpoken of; That he had life in himſelf, power to quicken and raiſe up whom he would, which might be demonſtrated, as well in quickning the generality of good and bad in their graves, as in every individual. Again, That diſtribution, <hi>Some to life, and ſome to condemnation,</hi> inforces onely that good and bad ſhall riſe, not every individual of either. Nor is the matter <hi>Res neceſſaria:</hi> Its in the power of God, and in his Will to raiſe All or ſome, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry individual, or but the moſt and generality. And yet though rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon cannot be preſſed to conclude it in ſo large an extent, yet Faith may be perſwaded ſo to believe it; It being ground enough for Faith to believe it ſo largely, That the words may bear it, and there is nothing of evidence from God againſt the largeſt it will bear. It being ſaucineſs in man to put in his limitations in matters of Faith, where Gods Spirit elſewhere, or the matter ſpoken of, doth not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily inforce a limitation.</p>

We grant it ſometimes is applied Diſtributively to ſorts, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time collectively, but deny that the word holds forth ſuch a Diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butive acceptation onely in the places controverted. His inſtance of <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.32. <hi>I will draw All men to me,</hi> is but beg'd: That it ſignifies all ſorts we grant, That it ſignifies not All individuals we deſire him to prove. He thinks to prove it thus, <q>
                        <hi>That all that come to him by the Fathers drawing, he will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi>
                     </q> But herein he prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates. For its not ſaid in any Scripture, That all that God draws come to Chriſt. Without his drawing none can come to him, but that every one that he draws come, we finde not. He drew <hi>Ephraim</hi> with the cords of love, and the bands of a man, but no where ſays, that they came to him upon it, but ſeems rather to complain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him of drawing back from him, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.3, 4.2. Nor doth Chriſt ſay, My Father ſhall draw all to me, but he ſpeakes of his own draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 3. Nor is it manifeſt what drawing he ſpeakes of, whether of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:117749:105"/>Grace onely to believe, or of power alſo to be judged. The latter it may be, or both. For of judging he was ſpeaking immediately before. And that not upon the gratious inquiring after him, as moſt refer it to that. <hi>verſ.</hi> 20.21. But upon the Fathers voyce coming to him, that he would glorifie him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 28, 29. Immediately upon which he ſays, <hi>Now is the judgment of this world,</hi> He ſays not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the world, but the judgment, and that began in the Prince of it. Now ſhall the Prince of the world be caſt out, and then afterward he will draw All to him, being lifted up Firſt, on the Croſs, ſecondly, in the Goſpel, thirdly, By the right hand of God to the Throne of Glory, a part of which glory is to judg All. Being thus lifted up, he will draw all to him, either by Grace to own him, or by his Power to be judged by him. And this he ſpake ſignifying what death he ſhould dye, as on the Croſs ſo a publike death, and ſuch as in and by which he ſhould receive authority over all fleſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> VVhy any ſhould exclude this drawing to judgment, I ſee not, he ſpeaking of judging the world, and why to deny it without reaſon for it, I ſee as little.

                        <hi>He gives us ſome concluſions about the ſignification of the word All, as</hi> 1. <hi>That it ſignifies All believers, ſo as to be reſtrained to them. So he ſays it is in</hi> Rom. 5.18.</q> 
                     <hi>To all men to juſtification of life.</hi> But there he is manifeſtly out. For the Apoſtle himſelf ſubjoyns the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantive to the word <hi>All, All men,</hi>

For for my part, I think not that all men are onely believers, and none but they, men. The 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22. <hi>In Chriſt all ſhall be made alive,</hi> He ſays, is not All men, but All believers onely. In which he intimately aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts one of theſe two Propoſitions, either that all men ſhall not riſe or be quickned to life again; or, that it ſhall not be in, or by Chriſt (for ſo this word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:117749:106"/>as All of them: he quotes alſo the 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 2. and tells us he thinks the Apoſtle by All, means All ſorts, and ſo he doth; but that he means but ſome of All ſorts is void of proof, for he ſaith not, ſome Kings and ſome peaſants, but Kings and all in Authority, he names but one Genus of men, men in authority, and he ſays all of that ſort, And why not all of all the other ſorts as well as that? I expect ſome reaſon (more then I ſhall meet with) before I believe it. Why all Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, all beggars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may not as well as all in authority be the object of my prayers, I know no reaſon: I think I have as good ground to think All of the one ſhall be ſaved, as All of the other.

                        <hi>He would have us compare the Generall expreſſions of the old and New Teſtament together; the Lord affirming in the New to be done, what was foretold in the old ſhould be done; ſo that they are anſwerable to and expoſitory one of another.</hi>
                     </q> Well, I accept the motion, but then this compariſon muſt be <hi>adidem,</hi> but ſo Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> compares not, for he compares prophecies of the converſion of Nations &amp; families to the Death of Chriſt for all, and his mediation for them: but this is not equal. The dying of Chriſt for a man was not the fulfilling of the prophecy of the converſion of that man, and of his coming to Chriſt.
<note place="margin">Act. 15.9, &amp; 13, 48. Col. 1.6.</note> Thoſe prophecies agree with theſe ſpeeches, God put no difference between them and us after that by faith he had purifyed their hearts; and this, The Gentiles glorified the Word of the Lord &amp; believed, ſo many as were ordained to eternall life, and this, The Goſpel is come to you as in all the world, and brings forth fruit as it doth alſo in you, and many the like. But that he gave himſelf a ranſome for All and is the propitiation of the ſins of the whole world, expound theſe praedictions of the converſion of All Nations, I deny, for theſe ſay not, All believe, or come to his holy mountain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that invitation in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.22. Look to me and be ye ſaved, all the ends of the earth; is a call, not a propheticall aſſertion That all the ends of the earth, ſhall look to him and be ſaved. So that this alſo is but a fruitleſs inept compariſon. Whereas he ſays, <hi>when God ſaith he will wipe off tears from all faces,
<note place="margin">Eſa 25 7.8.</note> it hinders not but the Reprobates may be caſt out tò eternity.</hi> I anſwer, He did in and by his Death wipe off tears from all faces; giving himſelf a ranſome for All, and being the propitiation for the ſins of the whole world he keeps off many a judgment that elſe would ſeize upon all, and produce many tears and much ſadneſs to them, yea and delivers all, from many a trouble and ſorrow that would elſe overwhelm them: though he doth not

Others abuſing his goodneſs, and ſinning againſt thoſe mercies towards them and deliverances of them, pull upon themſelves tears and ſorrows a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh, that ſhall never be wiped off them. And beſides, its more equal that the Apoſtolical expreſſions ſhould expound the prophetical, then on the contrary the prophetical to expound them, the prophetical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions being as in a darker manifeſtation of Chriſt, ſo more obſcure then the Apoſtolicall, who were to unfold the things of God more plainly.

And I trow the Devills might really ſmite him, or ſtrengthen men to it, and yet God ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prcamly ſmite him too; God as ſupreme Judge, Sathan as the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner or hangman, uſing men as inſtruments as in the caſe of <hi>Job.</hi> So that this fails too, but much more his after-proof of <hi>John</hi> 5.18. where he brings the Jews imputing to Chriſt that he brake the Sabbath
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:117749:107"/>day, in which they ſpake falſly to interpret Gods ſayings by his Apoſtles by, as if he ſpake ſo miſtakingly too. To which he adds, <q>
                        <hi>That many things proper and peculiar to the children of God are often aſſigned to them that live in outward communion with them, though in truth aliens in reſpect of inward participation of the grace ſo aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
                     </q> But whether things were ſo aſſigned to them by the unerring and infallible ſpirit of God, or by the erring and fallible ſpirit of men, he tels us not, nor in what Scriptures they aſſigned things to them as erring men that wrote not by Gods ſpirit. Therefore I can ſay no more at preſent to it, but that his concluſion, "<hi>That ſome may be ſaid to be redeemed,</hi>

                     </q> This I ſay in ſubſtance is one with the former, and both of them are dangerous principles, and the very openers of the gap to all the abundance of error brought in by the Antiſcripturiſts, they are directly their principles, That the Apoſtles writ as other good men by a judgment of charity and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and ſo what they ſay may be falſe, we muſt not ſquare them to verity becauſe they would not then hold out. And grant this that the Apoſtles were not in all things guided by an infallible ſpirit (except where they themſelves faithfully tell us ſo) and where ſhall we ſtay? who ſhall tell us where that infallible ſpirit aſsiſted them, and where it left them? Nay though <hi>Paul</hi> tels the <hi>Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> That he knew their Election and that of God, yet Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> will tell him he might be deceived in that knowledg though. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.4. and 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. But I believe <hi>Paul</hi> durſt not have ſaid, he knew it, if he did but think ſo, out of a charitable perſwaſion ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a truth fallibly applied to, or diſcerned in them. But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Apoſtles ſpake not of Election there, as Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> doth. He thought, perhaps, that it might be made firm or ſure, and perhaps it might be neglected. He perhaps ſpake of it, as <hi>Moſes</hi> of the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who though he tells them they were choſen to be a ſpecial people to God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.6, 7. and yet freely too, yet
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:117749:108"/>tells them, That if they walk after other Gods, and forget Him, they ſhould ſurely periſh as the other Nations that he deſtroyed before them, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.19, 20. I do but propound that to Mr. <hi>Owens</hi> conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as alſo whether he by Election meant not an actual choiſe of them, in pulling them out of the world, and bringing them to look after his ſalvation. But however I will by no means yield him, That the Apoſtle ſpake at random, and out of a fallible humane concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of charity, and not by the infallible Spirit, and ſo he hath no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage for his following. <hi>And why not?</hi> why not, when he ſays, <hi>That Chriſt died for ſome that might poſſibly periſh.</hi>

                     </q> Which we grant, underſtanding it of Faith rooted in the heart, and having ſingled the heart to God, for otherwiſe there is a degree or kinde of Faith not ſo infallibly attended with eternal ſalvation, as that compared to the ſtony ground, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.19, 20. <hi>And in thoſe that made ſhipwrack of faith and a good conſcience.</hi> But he ſays, <q>
                        <hi>That thats the ſubſtance of the Goſpel promulgation,</hi> whoever believe ſhall be ſaved, <hi>thats the onely thing held out to innumerable, That Faith ſhal be attended certainly with eternal life.</hi>
                     </q> Truly I believe that thats All the Goſpel held out to innumerable indeed. For they that know of no other Goſpel predicable to them (at leaſt believe it not) how ſhould they preach it? And truly, though thats a truth, yet not a truth meet to beget Faith, but that declares God in Chriſt an object fit for ſouls in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and particular to believe on. That thats all the divine Truth that God bids us preach as Goſpel to innumerable of men, I deny. He quotes for it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.16. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.11. but fails in them of his purpoſe. He ſhews his miſtake of the firſt, in that he thinks that that in <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. is a declaration of the Goſpel that they ſhould preach. As if our Saviour had ſaid, This is the Goſpel you ſhall preach, <hi>He that believes ſhall be ſaved, and he that believes not ſhall be damned.</hi> Now that this cannot be the Goſpel is plain, for then the latter ſentence, <hi>He that believes not ſhall be damned,</hi> ſhould be part of the Goſpel too, and ſo good news, which I ſuppoſe, will be hardly judged ſo. The truth is, Our having Saviour bid them preach the Goſpel, informs them what ſhould be the conſequences of their preaching it, <hi>He that believes,</hi> that is, that believes the Goſpel that you preach, ſhall be ſaved, but he that believes not but rejects it, ſhall be damned. The Goſpel that they were to preach was his Miſſion
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:117749:108"/>into the world as the Saviour of it, his Death for our ſins, his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, Aſcention, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with the promiſes of Life to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the Goſpel believe on him, and ſo the Apoſtle preached alſo (as we have before ſhewed.) We declare to you good tidings, that God hath performed his Promiſes to us in raiſing up Chriſt from the dead. And be it known, that in this mans name is preached to you remiſſion of ſins. And to inſtance no more, his other proof is plain, that they preached more fully then as he tells us. For in that 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.11. He ſays not onely this is the Record, that life is in Chriſt, and he that hath him hath it, but alſo (which he leaps over) God hath given us that life eternal that is in Chriſt, ſo as that it behoves us to receive it in receiving him, or elſe we are ingreateful and guilty of our own deſtruction. Whereas he chargeth us with a <q>
                        <hi>Conditional will in God for ſaving men,</hi>
                     </q> I ſpeak not of any thing conditional in him, but I ſay, God propounds to men ſalvation on condition, and will make good his VVord where-ever that condition is performed by men. That which follows in this Conſideration is ſpoken to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally before, and therefore I ſhall paſs it, and come to the next Conſideration.</p>
                  <p n="9">
                     <q>9. <hi>He mindes us of the mixt diſtribution of Elect and Reprobates,
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Conſid.</hi> 9.</note> Believers and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers throughout the world, in the ſeveral places thereof, in all, or moſt of the ſingle Congregations, and thats an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ground of tendring the blood of Chriſt to them for whom it was never ſhed.</hi>
                     </q> Here are a heap of beg'd queſtions, all without proof; As 1. That ſome are Elect and others Reprobates, before the Goſpel come to them, and faſten upon ſome to pull them to Chriſt, and his Juſtice paſs upon others in hardning them for their rejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt. 2. That there are believers, and unbelievers in the Congregations throughout the world antecedently to the Goſpels publiſhing to them, and therefore the Goſpel muſt be tendred to All, and the blood of Chriſt offered to them for whom it was never ſhed. 3. That there are ſome men for whom Chriſt never ſhed his blood, and that God hath ordered it to be offered to them. But 4. Chiefly, This is to be admired, that the holy Ghoſt that knows the ſecrets of God, and revealed them to the Apoſtles, ſhould out of theſe grounds, affirm, that Chriſt died, and gave himſelf a ranſom for All, when he wrote to one of the Churches. All which are no matters of our Faith till they have better proof. VVhat he ſays of the Promiſes there is impertinent, for its not of thoſe we ſpeak, but
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:117749:109"/>of the affirmations of the extent of Chriſts Death, Propitiation, and Ranſom, which are not promiſes upon any condition propounded, but Declarations and Aſſertions of things done for us in Chriſt, that are grounds to us for Faith: Even ſuch grounds as upon which the Apoſtles exhorts to Faith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.4. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19, 20. &amp;c. and from them (though not from the promiſes which are the believers por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) Faith meets with ſomething to perſwade us of his Death for All. VVhereas he ſays the offer is not abſolutely univerſal. If he ſpeak of it as profferd in act by men, its true, but if as proferable and according to the terms of its Propoſition in the Scripture, its untrue, for there its expreſly ſaid, <hi>To all the ends of the earth, and to the whole Creation.</hi> For Gods refuſing to beſtow Faith. I would have him ſhew me that God any where expreſſes himſelf as unwilling and unready to beſtow Faith upon men (where they have not firſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully rejected him) as if it was a vain thing to preach to moſt, and for moſt to hear, becauſe God will not afford them power of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving.</p>
                  <p n="10">
                     <q>10. <hi>His laſt Conſideration is of the ſeveral degrees of Faith,
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Conſid.</hi> 10.</note> tending to clear this, That men have an object fit to believe on, though they believe not that Chriſt died for them.</hi>
                     </q> Which I deny, for this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving on God (the onely ultimate object of Faith) being a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance or depending on him; preſuppoſes an apprehenſion of God, as one able and willing to help him, and that apprehenſion ſpringing from his VVord reporting him to be ſuch, which cannot be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended with this in queſtion, Whether God hath given Chriſt for him or not? for if that be doubted or uncertain, its uncertain too, whether God be willing to help him, ſeeing he hath appointed help no ways but by him, and through his dying for men. But let us ſee what are his Poſitions. He tels us there is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This <q>
                        <hi>That ſinners cannot have ſalvation in themſelves, in as much as all have ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God, Nor can be juſtified by the works of the Law.</hi>
                     </q> This is indeed a truth to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, but not properly Goſpel or good news, much leſs doth it ſhew the object to be believed on.</p>
                  <p n="2">"2. <hi>That life is to be had in the promiſed ſeed.</hi> But this is a lame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, for it expreſſes not whether life is there for them to whom its preached, or onely for ſome they know not who. If the latter, this not yet meet to beget faith in God in them, it being yet uncertain wheher he bean object for faith to them. That many believe not
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:117749:109"/>this that are outwardly called, is not material, nor proves that there is no more Goſpel-Truth that appertains to them propoſable to them. And indeed, one thing that makes many not believe it, is that they regard not the report of it, and they regard it not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps becauſe it propounds nothing for certain that may be benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to them.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <q>3. <hi>That Jeſus of</hi> Nazareth <hi>who was crucified at</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>was this Saviour.</hi>
                     </q> This alſo is a truth to be believed, but yet affords no certain ground or motive for any mans expecting good from God to himſelf, nor propounds him as a fit object for this or that man to believe on. But then</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He ſays, <q>
                        <hi>The Goſpel requires reſting in this Chriſt as an All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient Saviour, with whom is plenteous redemption, able to ſave to the utmoſt all that come to God by him.</hi>
                     </q> But can a ſoul reſt on him that it knows not to have done any thing for it to reſt in? To reſt in, is to ſit down, and be at quiet in the belief of ſomething in which the ſoul ſees it need ſtir no where elſe for ſatisfaction, but it may certainly have it there. But how can a man preach to any one, or he believe that Chriſt is an All-ſufficient Saviour as to him, and ſo meet for him to reſt on for ſafety, and yet cannot ſay by the Word of God That Chriſt died for him, or was appointed by God to be a Mediator for him to reſt on? Is Chriſt ſufficiently furniſhed for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a man without an offering made to God for him? Or can he remit his ſins without ſhedding blood for him? To come to God by Chriſt is through the viewing and conſidering his Perſon, Sufferings, and Mediation to be incouraged to hope in God, and in that hope to ask and waite for his ſalvation. Now what am I more helped for truſting in God, by believing that all that finde ſuch incouragement in him as Mediator, as that they are raiſed up to hope, and to have confidence in God thereby, have Him Al-ſufficient to ſave them, if in the mean time not knowing whether he be ſufficient to ſave me, that is, whether he hath done any thing as Mediator for me, I cannot ſee incouragement from thence to hope and reſt on God for his ſaving me? Its true, few within the Pale of the Church may finde ſtrength to perform that act of reſting on God, and that is becauſe they ſee not, nor are ſhewed what ground they have to do ſo. They are held in ſuſpenſe about their right to reſt on him, or to think he is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for them. They ſee not the way of entrance to God, how then ſhould they approach by it, but deceive themſelves oftentimes
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:117749:110"/>in thinking they approach to him when they do not. The Truth of God which being believed ſhould work in them effectually to draw them to God, is kept back from him, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is a Mediator between God and them, who hath died for them. That Word of God, is ſuſpended upon acts in themſelves, which indeed properly ſlow forth from that Truth firſt believed by them. Its love in God diſcovered to us that makes us hope in, and ſtay upon him, but that in this way is held back from men till they do hope in him, and ſo the Cart is ſet before the Horſe; the thing that ſhould draw us is ſet after our drawing in. O poor prepoſterous way that ſouls are led in!</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Now after all this, He tells us, <q>
                        <hi>We are called on every one in particular to believe the efficacy of the Redemption that is in the blood of Chriſt towards our ſouls.</hi>
                     </q> This alſo is obſcurely, or prepoſterouſly laid down: <hi>For why, I pray,</hi> ſays he, <hi>The efficacy of that Redemption is then to be believed, and not rather our intereſt in that act of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer in giving himſelf a ranſom for us?</hi> Doth he think that came in before? why then did he in no place mention it, and ſhew where it comes in that we are to believe that Chriſt died for us? The effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacies of his Redemption in and upon us, we indeed look for, and expect in and upon our coming to him, and we therefore come to him that we might receive them, even grace and mercy to help us in times of need, and in believing and reſting on him we ſhall experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment them. After believing we are aſſured of remiſſion of ſins, and eternal life; but where come we to know that Chriſt died for us, and ſo that the Mediation of Chriſt hath that in it for us that we may be imboldned by to hope in God? Men talk of Gods working faith by an Almighty power in them, as if he wrought it through the Air, and not by opening his love and goodneſs in the Mediation of Chriſt, and ſo by his VVotd that declares him. I cannot but queſtion a great many of theſe mens faith, whether they yet know what it truly is, they talk ſo ſtrangely of the working of it. Its by an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power its true, ay but thats put forth in the Record of the Goſpel concerning Gods goodneſs in Chriſt to us. Doth he mean by efficacy of Redemption, but this, that Chriſt died for us? Beſide that, thats an notable confuſion of an act done without us for us, and the operations of it by faith in us, it croſſes the way of the Apoſtles, who laid down the Goſpel thus; <hi>There is one God, and one Mediator between God and man</hi> (they ſtaid not there. Nor yet at this) <hi>the Man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Which is all the Goſpel that Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> hints at that is to
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:117749:110"/>be preached before mens coming to reſt on God, but the Apoſtle goes a ſtep further, <hi>Who gave himſelf a ranſom for All.</hi> All this the Apoſtle, the Teacher of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in faith and verity, lays down as the Teſtimony of God, the object of our Faith concerning God and Chriſt, the foundation of our approaching to God for ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the demonſtration that God would have us ſaved. Now whats the matter that men can dare to venture upon all the other parts or ſteps of the Goſpel Truth, to be preached to men; as that there is a difference between God and Man, a Mediator and Saviour appointed for men, and that this is the Man <hi>Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> and then in ſtead of the laſt, <hi>He gave himſelf a ranſom for All,</hi> boggling at that and avoiding it as a dangerous rock, put in this, That you muſt reſt upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

No, no, Our charge yet ſtands faſter againſt them then that the ſtrongeſt hand of them All can move it. They cannot preach, or repreſent God Doctrinally in that their way as an object that the people they ſpeak to hath good ground to reſt in for ſafety and ſatisfaction; for they know not (confeſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) whether he hath appointed Chriſt as a <hi>medium</hi> of acceſs for them, and as a Sacrifice and Ranſom for their ſouls, They can tell men he is able to ſave them that believe (provided they be the Elect, otherwiſe not) but cannot aſſure that he is a meet object for them to believe through, becauſe they cannot aſſure them he hath done any thing for them.

Beſides, it may be ſeen by indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. No other Truth that is ſo frequently laid down in ſuch gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral terms is taken limitedly to fewer, if no other Scripture limit or reſtrain it, or the very Circumſtances of the places where it is, as might be inſtanced in Creation, Sinfulneſs, Preſervation, Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Judgment. The <hi>Minor</hi> hath been cleared throughout this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, that though there be places that ſpeak not of all its object (as alſo there are many about Creation, Sin. Reſurrection, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) yet there is no limitation of it in any of thoſe places as a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom or Propitiation to a leſs object then the general places will reach to. And that the largeſt expreſſions are uſed about it, is clear, as <hi>All men, Rom.</hi> 5.18 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2 6. <hi>Every one, Heb</hi> 2.9. <hi>The whole world.</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.2. That thoſe phraſes are in themſelves extendible to <hi>All,</hi>
                     <pb n="185" facs="tcp:117749:111"/>and Every man in the world, is plain, and confeſt by Mr. <hi>Owen,</hi> That ſometimes in the Scriptures they are ſo uſed, and that very uſually too, and moſt properly, as is eaſie to ſhew, And therefore may ſo ſignifie there. His Argumentations from the word <hi>World,</hi> I diſclaim, nor doth he finde any ſo to uſe them as he propounds them. We argue not the extent ſimply from the word <hi>World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> but from the words <hi>All,</hi> and <hi>Every,</hi> and <hi>whole World;</hi> and we underſtand the word <hi>World</hi> extendible as far as them, not from the word <hi>World</hi> ſimply, but from theſe other places reaching it to the whole World, and All men. As when its ſaid, <hi>God created man upon the earth,</hi> the force of the word <hi>Man</hi> proves it not that he created every Man in the world, but yet we believe it extendible ſo far, becauſe other Scriptures ſay it of All Nations of men, and that he made them of one blood. The Argument from the word <hi>World,</hi> we uſe againſt their conceit of <hi>For the Elect onely.</hi> In that we never finde any Scripture, calling the world <hi>Elect,</hi> or the Elect the <hi>World,</hi> but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing them from the world, they being in election ſeparated from the world, They that would have us reſtrain general words but to ſome particulars, muſt ſhew us ſome ground for it, that the Scripture ſomewhere in the ſame buſineſs ſo reſtraineth them, for the reſtraining of a word uſually and Properly of a large extent in other things, is no ſufficient ground for our ſtraitning it, in this, or another thing where the Scripture doth not plainly declare that it ought to be ſo ſtraitned. And this is our defence againſt them in ſtraitning this Word to the <hi>Elect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> endeavors to ſhew, that the general words in ſuch places ought to be ſtraitned from the conſideration of the places themſelves. Beginning with that in <hi>Joh</hi> 3 16. In which (the great Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the world aſſiſting us) we will follow him. He thereupon firſt gives us our conſtruction of the place, and that with as much weakneſs as he can. I ſhall give my Paraphraſe my ſelf thus. God beholding man faln (even the men of the world) pitied him in that condition, and out of pity to him, ſent him for a Saviour his own onely Son, to this end, and with this intention, that he dying for him, and riſing again, and being perfected for ſaving man, all thoſe of mankinde whoſoever that upon declaration of him do believe on him, ſhould not periſh but have eternal life. In which obſerve,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the motive of Gods ſending his Son, was that love or good will that he bore to loſt man, and readineſs to ſhew forth
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:117749:112"/>his mercy to them in providing a fit <hi>medium</hi> and way to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The object of this love was Mankinde faln (as here expreſſed) indefinitely, but as other Scriptures explain this indefinite, <hi>All men,</hi> the <hi>whole world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. His act of giving was both to death for men, and in the Goſpel preaching Him to men as an object to be believed on.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The end, <hi>That whoſoever believes ſhould not periſh.</hi> In which we have</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Way to the participation of the choiſe benefits of him, <hi>viz.</hi> believing on him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Extent of that choiſe benefit, <hi>whoſoever believes.</hi> In which is alſo the freedom for all, or any to look after that benefit, and through Faith to obtain it.</p>
                  <p>Now in this Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> differs from us, <q>
                        <hi>That he notes the</hi> world <hi>to ſignifie loſt men of all ſorts both</hi> Jews <hi>&amp;</hi> Gentiles <hi>peculiarly loved, and that love to be an unchangeable act or purpoſe of Will concerning their ſalvation intending abſolutely the ſalvation of all this world to whom he gave him, &amp; that</hi> whoſoever believeth, <hi>not to be a diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of that general the</hi> world, <hi>but the very ſelf-ſame with the word</hi> World.</q> Before he confirm his own, he labors to evert the other, and</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Againſt that pity or propenſity to be affirmed to be in God to the good of the creature, he ſays thus, <q>
                        <hi>If there be no natural affection in God whereby he is neceſſarily carried to any thing without himſelf, then no ſuch pity or affection to their good as is here intended.</hi>
                     </q> I deny the Conſequence, for though there be no ſuch thing as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily is ſo carried, yet there is thats voluntarily and freely carried ſo. Gods Will that is in him to do this or that, is not neceſſarily car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to do this or that, but freely, but being freely carried to this or that, its neceſſarily carried in a way ſuteable to his holy &amp; good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Now that there is that in God that carries him to deſire or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove freely the good of man, appears in that he is ſaid to be Love, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.8. Now Love freely ſeeks the good of things. So again he ſwears that he delights not in the death of the wicked, but rather that they ſhould turn &amp; live. Yea, and ſaith of him that dieth, That he hath no pleaſure in his death, <hi>Eze.</hi> 33.11. &amp; 18. <hi>ult.</hi> And bewails thoſe that had miſcarried through their folly, and deprived themſelves of his mercy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.11.14. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 48.17, 18. And ſo our Saviour, the expreſs Image of God, wept over, and pitied the folly and miſery
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:117749:112"/>of <hi>Jeruſalem, Luke</hi> 19.41. But then he ſays, <q>
                        <hi>This intimates im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection in God, But he is not imperfect.</hi>
                     </q> I anſwer no, the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is in our conception, this in him is higheſt perfection. As <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, He is perfect, though he ſays, He took the <hi>Iſaelites</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> to bring them into <hi>Canaan,</hi> and many came not in, that might ſeem an imperfection in God, and that he failed of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed purpoſe, but the imperfection is in our apprehenſion. So he ſaid of <hi>Elies</hi> houſe, He would eſtabliſh it, but afterwards ſaid other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. But we are to believe what he ſays, though it ſeem to us, who want ability to comprehend him, to argue imperfection. The reſt of his Reaſonings are meer carnal, he brings no patch of Scripture to prove that God hath not ſuch good will to man, but vainly pries and inquires, <q>
                        <hi>Why doth not God ingage his power to accompliſh it, and how comes it hindered?</hi>
                     </q> Which are brutiſh reaſonings againſt Gods Aſſertions. When he ſays, Hadſt thou done thus, I would have done ſo, and ſo. And O that thou hadſt done ſo, And I delight ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſhould live, Then to ſay, why doth not God effect it then? Nay rather, Who is vain brutiſh man, duſt and aſhes, to diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, and reject his Words upon his ſhallow Reaſon? Will man propound to God what ſhall be Wiſdom to him! Doth not he indeed ſay, That his Wiſdom is fooliſhneſs to men? And doth not Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> here make it good, and ſay, <q>
                        <hi>Its brutiſh wiſdom amongſt men?</hi>
                     </q> But know, O vain Earth-worm, That the Wiſdom of God is indeed fooliſhneſs to men, and they cannot comprehend it, and the wiſdom of men is fooliſhneſs to God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.19.22.23, 24. Its wiſdom (O vain man) to give credit to the Word and Oath of God, and ſay Amen to it, That he delights not in the death of the wicked, but rather that they ſhall turn and live, how ever fooliſh it ſeems to man, and whatever abſurdities his wiſdom findes in it: For the fooliſhneſs of God is wiſer then the wiſdom of man, and that weakneſs and imperfection that appears in Gods wayes, is ſtronger then the ſtrength of men. <hi>His ways are unſearchable &amp; his judgments paſt finding out,</hi> Not to be meaſured by the ſhallow models our Reaſon, but his Words are all Words of Truth, and he that will underſtand his Wayes muſt believe them, and be willing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the wiſdom of the fleſh (which is enmity to God, and which God will deſtroy) and become a fool that he may be wiſe. The Scriptures, we ſee, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.14. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 48.17, 18. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11. and 18.32. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. hold forth what I ſpeak of. The Nature of God which
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:117749:113"/>is Love, acting forth it ſelf in expreſſions of good Will to men, yea, men in general, and ſuch as miſcarry. His other exception with its confirmations, being onely againſt his acting neceſſarily, are all vain and invalid.</p>
                  <p>For conformation of his own Expoſition, <q>
                        <hi>That by Love is meant an unchangeable purpoſe, or act of his Will to ſave them, He gives this Reaſon, Becauſe its the moſt eminent and tranſcendent love that ever God bare, or ſhewed towards any miſerable creature.</hi>
                     </q> Well, Let us firſt reade it according to his Expoſition, and ſee what it will help him. It will run thus. God ſo Loved, that is, unchangeably purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſalvation of the world, <hi>That he gave his onely begotten Son, that whoſever believeth in him ſhould not periſh,</hi> &amp;c. Which is in effect, that he ſo unchangeably purpoſed the ſalvation of loſt mankinde, as that he provided the moſt eminent tranſcendent <hi>medium</hi> for it to be ſaved by upon condition of believing. And ſo it will be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable conditional purpoſe to the world, and an unchangeable abſolute purpoſe to believers that have that condition. And may it not conſiſt, or rather ſpring from his pity and compaſſion to faln man ſo to will and purpoſe? Yea, and may not the word <hi>Love,</hi> rather ſignifie that pity in which he ſo purpoſed, then that purpoſe that ſprung therefrom, ſeeing its the more prime moving cauſe of his ſending Chriſt that is here ſpoken of? Or will this Expoſition content him? No, (though this is as much as the words will bear with the following expreſſions in the Text) yet this is not it he aims at; but this, That his Love ſignifies, an abſolute unchangeable purpoſe of ſaving every one for whom he gave Chriſt, and ſo of giving, and cauſing them all effectually to receive whatſoever is needful to their ſalvation. But the Text ſpeaks not up to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, for then it ſhould rather have been thus, God ſo loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Son, and will make it believe in him ſo that it ſhall never periſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But neither ſuch, not to that purpoſe is our Saviours expreſſion. Such an expreſſion indeed would have repreſented God as propounding the ſalvation of the world, as an end undertaken by himſelf to accompliſh and bring about with all the <hi>mediums</hi> conducing thereunto without condition on our part, whereas our Saviour ſpeaks of it as an end propounded to, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable by the world on condition of believing, as healing was to the wounded <hi>Iſraelites</hi> by looking upon the brazen Serpent, unto which Chriſt is reſembled, <hi>ver.</hi> 14, 15. Chriſt ſo ſets Gods good
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:117749:113"/>will before the world there, as may let it ſee and move it to believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as its duty: But as M. <hi>Owen</hi> would have it underſtood, we may ſay VVhat He would faſten upon us, <hi>Solvite mortales curas,</hi> &amp;c. Let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man take his own courſe, and ſwim down the ſtream of a fatal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity. If there be any ſalvation to be had for him, he muſt have it, God will bring him to it though he look not after it: and if it be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, its in vain to think of it, its not ſo much his fault, as Gods Wil that he believs not, as a late Reſolver hath too badly inſinuated. While he determins that there is no other cauſe why ſome believe not the Goſpel preached to them, but only the Wil of God himſelf.</p>
                  <p>As for his Reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe this is the moſt eminent and tranſcendent love of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That would be conſidered how far its true, and whether it will inſorce his conception quite beſide the tenor of our Saviours expreſſions. Love may be conſidered, either according to the things it acts forth as tending to the good of the party loved; or according to the inward ſtrength of affection, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording us means of good, or poſſeſſing us of that good. In regard of the firſt, this wasa moſt glorious eminent and tranſcendent act of Love. God afforded many means of good to the world, but none of them in themſelves ſo worthy and ſo glorious as his Son, nor is there any thing in which either ſo much of Gods heart or good will to the world is to be ſeen that he delights not in their death, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their converſion and living, or ſo much good to be met with as in him. In nothing hath God condeſcended more to man, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided ſo much good for him. As to its act then, and proviſion of means to our good, this is the moſt eminent act of his Love to us. But yet this act of giving Chriſt is but the proviſion of good for us, and of the beſt mean and way to it. Its not the poſſeſſing us of the good in him; with reference to that, ſome that were loved ſo, as to have Chriſt given as a way to life for them, may not be the objects of ſo intenſe affection as others for whom he alſo gave Chriſt; nor come to experiment that love of Delight or Fellowſhip, in which his Love in giving Chriſt perfects it ſelf in them that believe on him. This act then, I ſay, of love to the world, in which God gave forth Chriſt, though it be the moſt eminent and tranſcendent in regard of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of a mean to its good, and though it be that through which the moſt choiſe delightful acts of his Love are met with by thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on him, yet as its comprehenſive of the world is not an abſolute purpoſe of all their ſalvation. The ſame moſt eminent expreſſion of
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:117749:114"/>Love may be acted toward many, and out of exceeding great good will to them All too, and yet may not be with the like intenſneſs and eminency of affection and purpoſe for endevouring to make it beneficial to All, as we noted above in the inſtance of <hi>David lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. In a word Gods greateſt love to the world, was not an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable abſolute purpoſe of ſaving every one of them, and therefore the giving Chriſt out of love to the world, was not a giving him out of ſuch a purpoſe to ſave every one of them. The phraſe, <hi>So God loved,</hi> will not evince it. For though that word <hi>[So]</hi> intimates ſo exeeedingly, ſo really and heartily, to ſuch a remarkable aſtoniſhable heighth, yet it proves not either that he loved it equally to his Son, or ſo as to purpoſe abſolutely the eternal ſalvation of all of them. For our Saviour expreſſing that <hi>[So]</hi> tells us that it was ſo as to give his Son, <hi>That every one that believes in him ſhould not periſh,</hi> &amp;c. but not ſo as to give all things to it, as he ſays of his Son, <hi>v.</hi> 35. which yet is the ſame love in which he loves his choſen, his called and believing ones. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.24. Nor ſays he, ſo as to cauſe them to believe in him, and have eternal life. So that that word <hi>[So]</hi> will not prove that his conception.</p>
                  <p>Its true (as he alſo minds us) That the Scripture ſays, God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his Love to us in this, <hi>That Chriſt died for us,</hi> though thats not all the commendation of it, but that he did that for us while we were ſinners and ungodly. And I think its a marvellous commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Love that he died for All while ſinners; and they are the more to blame that withhold this ſo great commendation from multitudes by which they ſhould be induced to believe in him, love, and ſerve him. But will that prove that that Love was not his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion and pity towards men, that is therein commended, or that it was an unchangeable purpoſe of making all thoſe he ſo loved to anſwer his love with love again, and ſo to attain to eternal ſalvation? Cannot Love be commendable, exceeding commendable, except it be ſo received by all it acts towards as to make them grateful, and ſo to attain the effects that it produces to the grateful? Was not Gods Love to <hi>Iſrael</hi> in bringing them out of <hi>Egypt</hi> by a mighty hand and outſtretched arm, and taking them out of the midſt of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Nation by ſigns and wonders, to be a people for himſelf, and ſpeaking to them out of the midſt of the fire from heaven an exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing commendable love, a love flowing from (and moſt eminently of any other acts tending to the accompliſhment of) his Covenant made
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:117749:114"/>with <hi>Abraham, Deut.</hi> 4.31, 32, 33, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet all they, to, and upon whom all thoſe moſt glorious acts of his love were acted, were not therefore poſſeſſed of that end, The land promiſed to <hi>Abraham</hi> to which they tended; nor was his love therein then a purpoſe abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to poſſeſs them of that end, except (as Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> here argues) he failed of his end. The greater commendation it is of Gods Love that he gave Chriſt, the greater ingagement it is to the world to believe on him, love and ſerve him, and the greater its ſin that it not ſo anſwer ſuch a love to them, and the greater will his terror be in judging them, that Chriſt died for All, and yet many that had their lives through his Death, lived not to him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10, 11.15. for God is a jealous God and may be provoked to jealouſie by men; and what is jealouſie but love inraged, or the fury that ſprings up from love abuſed, as when he that loves hath his love ſlighted and others prefer'd before him? Sure the Apoſtle uſes this very love and its greatneſs as an argument of terror to them that ill requite it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it, or receive it in vain, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. with 6.1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3. and 10.26.29. and 12.22.24.25. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.10, 11. which were vain arguings, if becauſe this love was ſo commendable, therefore it was an abſolute unchangeable purpoſe of bringing all that Chriſt was given for, to eternal ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>But he ſays further (<hi>Argum.</hi> 3.) <q>
                        <hi>That Gods love is a</hi> Velle bonum alicui, <hi>a willing good to them He loves, and therefore ſure they are the object of his Love to whom he intends the good which is the iſſue and effect of his love,</hi> viz. <hi>not periſhing but having eternal life, But that happens onely to the Elect, Believers,</hi> &amp;c.</q> In which Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſlipt out of the matter in hand, the nature of the love, to the object of it, and builds his Argument but upon an Axiom of the Schoolmen that were not ſo far Gods privy Councellors, as that we may build our ſaith upon all their Maxims. And he faulters too in his Argument. For whereas his <hi>Major</hi> ſpeaks of Gods intending that end and iſſue that men periſh not, His <hi>Minor</hi> tells us of what happens, which makes his Argument to continue a <hi>Quartus terminus.</hi> Surely God tells us, he ſo far intends not periſhing &amp; eternal life to others, that he hath no delight in the death of the wicked, but rather that they turn and live, and that he willeth not that any periſh, but that all come to Repentance, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. I know becauſe men think themſelves wiſe in this world, and prefer their Philoſophical Rules before the Apoſtles counſel, <hi>To become fools that they may be wiſe,</hi>
                     <pb n="192" facs="tcp:117749:115"/>that they will not bear the truth of thoſe ſayings, but muſter up ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt them, and ſay with <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> How can theſe things be? if God willed not that they periſh, but that all ſhould come to Repentance, then theſe things muſt happen to all, and none are loved of God, but they to whom thoſe things happen. And ſo they will teach men to blaſpheme that goodneſs of God that leads men to repentance, and to ſay, It was not goodneſs becauſe they are not prevailed with, but according to their own hard hearts, treaſure up wrath to themſelves by ſinning againſt it, yea and will make this ſo wonderfull a tranſcendent teſtimony of Love no love, except it had been, God ſo loved the world, that he not only gave his ſon that every one that believes might not periſh, but alſo will make men ſo to believe and receive him that they ſhall never periſh. VVell then might the Iſraelites for the far greateſt part of them ſay, Its in vain for us to ſerve God, and wherein hath he loved us? ſeeing whatever great things he did for them, they found not that he ſo abſolutely purpoſed their eternall ſalvation that he would by his omnipotent power compell them to it, for but a remnant of them ſhall be ſaved. But for that willing none to periſh, but rather to turn and live, and ſo a willing ſalvation to men, God may be ſaid ſo to will two wayes. Firſt, In willing it to be, and ſo providing it in Chriſt and propounding it to men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and willing or requiring them to look to him for it, with promiſe of conferring it on them in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 2. To purpoſe or determine that this or that man abſolutely ſhall be ſaved. In the firſt way he hath willed ſalvation to the world in generall, having put it in Chriſt and willed the Goſpell to be preached throughout the VVorld, and they all to liſten to it, and obey it, but not in the ſecond way. Now ſome may not receive, or receive in vain Gods grace, willing their ſalvation in the firſt way, and turn it into wantonneſs, and ſo it hath not in them its effect it hath in others that receive it throughly: ſhall we therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude There was no grace extended to them, the other only and not they were the object of his love in providing ſalvation for and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding it to the world? But he adds,</p>
                  <p n="4">(4) <q>
                        <hi>This that was the cauſe of giving Chriſt, is the cauſe of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all good things with him,</hi> Rom. 8.32. <hi>therefore it muſt be towards them only that have all thoſe good things.</hi>
                     </q> I deny the conſequence. The ſame love that led God to appoint the brazen Serpent for heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, led him to heal them that looked up; <hi>Ergo</hi> he ſet it up
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:117749:115"/>only for them that looked up. This argument ſlides alſo from the nature of the love to the Object of it. The ſame love that led God to give his Son to the World, leads him to give eternall life to them of the World that believe, and ſo to give us that believe All things; but it follows not therefore that the object of Gods love in its firſt act was not diſtinct from, or at leaſt not larger then Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</p>

                     </q> My Reaſon for mine is, 1. Becauſe the word World (ſpeaking <hi>de mundo contento</hi>) primarily ſo ſignifies, as, He ſhall judge the World in Righteouſneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.8. How then ſhall God judge the World? and, All the World is become guilty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.6, 9. 2. Becauſe Chriſt is expreſly ſaid to be the propitiation for the ſins of the whole World, the Ranſom for All men. 3. Becauſe it here ſuſtains the nature of a whole, out of which believers are taken as parts. He loved the world, that every one that believes, that is, that every one of it or of the world that believes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thats evidently the ſenſe of the place. Now its non-ſenſe to ſay, That every one of the Elect that believe, for that intimates that ſome of them might not believe. Its as if he ſhould have ſaid of the Iſraelites, He brought <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that they that follow him obediently in the wilderneſs might enter into <hi>Canaan,</hi> like that in <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.48. where the ſame phraſe is uſed, I am come a light un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, that whoſoever believes in me ſhould not abide in darkneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He is a light to every man, <hi>John</hi> 1.9. a light to them that hate his light, <hi>Joh</hi> 3.19. but they for hating of it ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of it and abide in darkneſs, <hi>John</hi> 12.35, 26. but all of this world to whom he vouchſafes his light, that believe in him, ſhall not abide in darkneſs.</p>
                  <p>But Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſays, <q>
                        <hi>By the World are meant the Elect ſcattered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in the World oppoſed to the Nation of the Jews;</hi>
                     </q> that this laſt
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:117749:116"/>clauſe is untrue, appears by this that he was ſpeaking this to a Jew to draw him to believe, and therefore the Word World muſt not be oppoſed to them as excluding them: but let us ſee how he refutes ours, and confirms his own opinion.</p>
                  <p>Againſt our latter obſervation from the reading of the Words, He ſo loved the Elect that all of them that believe ſhould not periſh, <hi>viz.</hi> that it would ſeem by that as if ſome of them might not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, he replies, why? "<hi>Becauſe he ſent his Son that they might not periſh!</hi> To that I anſwer, No, but becauſe the phraſe is Diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butive, not [that it believing] as ſuppoſing that all that VVorld that Chriſt was given for ſhall believe, but [that whoſoever, or every one that believes] as ſuppoſing that though there is ground for all the VVorld to believe, yet all would not. So that the place holds not forth that Chriſt muſt and will keep from periſhing All for whom he was given, as Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſuggeſts, but all whoſoever and whatſoever that believe in him. But he anſwers again, <q>
                        <hi>That God deſigns the ſalvation of all them in expreſs words for whom he ſent his Son.</hi>
                     </q> To that I reply, that (by deſigning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> meaning his purpoſing to bring them All to eternal ſalvation) its openly untrue, for he ſays no ſuch thing there, that he loved the world, and gave his Son that every one of it ſhould be made to believe and be ſaved, as I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the Text it ſelf, but if he mean, (as he doth not) that ſalvation might be propounded to it, and it have a way by which it might in believing come to be ſaved, then I deny it not, but ſo its ſaid of unbelievers, <hi>John</hi> 5.34, 40. VVhereas we ſay that, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is diviſive and partitive as to that <hi>Totum,</hi> the word world go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before: to this he ſays, that If it be ſo, then it reſtrains Gods love to ſome and not to others. I anſwer No, but it it ſhews by whom and by what way the utmoſt end of this love, or moſt choiſe bleſſing of it is to be injoyed. Gods love in providing a <hi>Medium</hi> through which men might look for and meet with ſalvation reſpects the world in generall; nor doth that ſaying, that whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, put a bar againſt any of the world, as if they might not in looking up to Chriſt be ſaved, but it implies that the world as ſimply ſuch, or as in that ſtate of ſin and blindneſs in which God out of pity ſent his Son for it, is not the object of Gods abſolute inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to give eternall life, but thoſe of it that believe; and the word Whoſoever, is both an incouragement for all or any to believe, and carries in it a ſuppoſition that the whole VVorld likely might not
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:117749:116"/>believe. As the ſetting up the brazen Serpent (to whom Chriſt is compared, <hi>ver.</hi> 14.) was an act of love to all the ſtrange Iſraelites, though the benefit of healing was to be obtained in their looking up to it, and by none of them that refuſed to look up; ſo was the gift of Chriſt to the world, though the unbeliever not receiving him is not ſaved. But then,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He denies that that phraſe is reſtrictive, but only declarative of his end, how its not reſtrictive I have even now ſaid, but that its Diſtinctive, not taking in the whole world as the certain Object or ſubject of eternall life, is ſhewed alſo, and is very evident I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to all that have but common judgment, and ſo that its not only Declarative of his end, but declarative of it in ſuch a way or expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as implies that the Object that injoyes that end, may (at leaſt) be fewer then the object of giving him to ſuch an end. Its not, that all the world ſhall not periſh, but that whoſoever believeth periſh not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Beſides no other Scripture ſays that the whole world for whom Chriſt was given, did or ſhall believe on him, but expreſly to the contrary, that ſome to whom God gave Him as the true bread, ſaw and believed not, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6.32, 36. and that many to whom he came received him not, He came to his own things, amongſt which his own Nation was, and his own Nation or people received him not. So that for his expoſition we have nothing but his bare ſaying; and that offering violence to the Text too; as if it had been ſaid, <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>Giving a reaſon of this that he ſays it was an act of his love to the world; whereof he gives a double proofe, one Negative, he ſent him not to condemne the world, the other affirmative, but that the world through him might be ſaved,</hi> he ſays, <hi>the word World there muſt needs ſignifie believers and Elect, becauſe its ſaid that the World through him might be ſaved, which if it be underſtood of any but believers, God muſt needs fail of
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:117749:117"/>his end.</hi>
                     </q> This is anſwered before in the firſt Chapter of the firſt Book, where he have ſhewed.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. "That the word <hi>ſaved</hi> is ſometimes uſed in a lower ſenſe then the having eternal life, as the deliverance out of that condemnation fore-come upon us, and ſo the world may be ſaid to be ſaved, and the grace of God ſaving to All men, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That ſuch ſpeeches do not always declare the intention of God which he will bring about, but an end propounded to men, which they in attending to the means ſet before them ought to preſs after, and might attain to, and that its his good will they ſhould look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, and in looking after it attain to it. See the Inſtances thereof <hi>Acts</hi> 17.26, 27. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.44, 45. Like to which is this. <hi>He ſent his Son into the world, not to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be ſaved;</hi> that is, That he being filled with authority, power, and ſufficiency to ſave them, they might have him as a Saviour or way to ſalvation to look and liſten to, and in walking in his Light and Truth might attain ſalvation. Which end ſet before them, they many of them miſs by deſpiſing him who is the way to it. Therefore our Saviour diſtributing the world in two parts in the next <hi>verſe,</hi> tells us, not who might have been ſaved by him, but, who they are that attain the end pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to them, <hi>viz.

<note place="margin">Heb. 2, 3. and 12.25.</note> harden their hearts, neglect ſo great ſalvation, and refuſes him that ſpeaks for heaven,) he is now judged, Now in the day of the Goſpel. However God might wink at mens igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances in former times, yet Now God will not bear it that men ſhould deſpiſe him that ſpeaks to them more fully for their good (His Son preaching ſalvation to them,) but judges him. The word judges him, and the Spirit condems him, and makes this word of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation a Savour of death unto death to him, becauſe he hath not believed on the Name of the onely begotten Son, becauſe he did not truſt to him for healing, when the Goſpel declared ſuch readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ability in him to heal them. Which why, or how it ſhould be, if Chriſt was not ſent for them, and was neither ſufficient nor willing to ſave them, as was ſaid, <hi>Chap.</hi>

                        <hi>Which ſaith Mr.</hi> Owen, <hi>he onely is of them that are ſaved: a Saviour of men not ſaved, is ſtrange.</hi>
                     </q> But how that may be true, we have hinted in the former Argument. Beſides,
<note place="margin">According to 1 Tim. 4.10.</note> Is this ſo ſtrange to denominate a perſon by his Authority and Office, rather then from his actings onely in that Authority. May not a man be called Lord chief Juſtice of all <hi>England,</hi> though he do not execute Juſtice to all perſons in <hi>England,</hi> or cannot ſo do by reaſon that many decline his Juſtice-executing? So, may not a man be called, and indeed be a Phyſition for a whole Town by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of Authority, though many in it refuſe to take Phyſick of him when they are ſick? And is not many a man conſtituted Miniſter of, and preacher to all ſuch a Congregation, when yet perhaps half of them deſpiſe his Miniſtery, and refuſe to hear him? Shall not he be called the Miniſter of that Pariſh wholly, becauſe many refuſe to have his Miniſtry acted towards them? So Chriſt is the Saviour of the World, both in that, 1. He is He in and through whom God is the Saviour of All men, God not ſaving any man in any ſenſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, but his Son doing all from him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.22. And 2. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that he is ſet up and held forth in the Goſpel as filled and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for ſaving All, or any man upon looking to him, and all commanded to look to him to be ſaved by him. And in the ſame ſenſe He is ſaid to give life to the World, both in that its through his Mediation that the World hath a being under goodneſs and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, contrary to the deſert of their ſin, which (had God dealt with man according to the demerit of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, and the ſtrict ſenſe of his own VVord pronounced upon him) none in the world had had, but (if they had not been all forthwith cut off in <hi>Adam</hi>) their beings would have been as far from Gods goodneſs and mercy, as the being of the Devils, which is not worthy the name of life, nor is ſo called in any Scripture, as mans is. And this is (as I conceive) that life out of which he prayes that his malicious enemies might be blotted, for in the book of the righteous (which is of eternal life) they are not written, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 96.28. for which life He gave his Fleſh to bear that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that otherways in the day in which <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned ſhould have faln upon him and the whole world in him; As he is called the Light that inlightneth every man that comes into the world, meaning it of lower hints of light then what the believer peculiarly receives from
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:117749:118"/>him. So that his other Quotations of <hi>John</hi> 6.33.51. are as meerly beg'd as any other, and as little pertinent, they being thus to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted. As alſo that he gives, expoſes, and holds forth liſe in the Goſpel to the world, as in <hi>ver.</hi> 32. The Father is ſaid to have given him to them, and yet the world neither receives him, nor the life tendered and freely given in and by him, <hi>Joh</hi> 1.10, 11. and 5.4. and 6.36. But he tells us that Chriſt in <hi>John</hi> 10.27, 28. Says, He gives life to his ſheep onely; which is neither right nor pertinent, for he neither puts in the word <hi>onely,</hi> nor ſpeaks of the life of the world, but of eternal life. Which, if we take <hi>given</hi> for a free holding forth to men,
<note place="margin">Compare Mark 15.23. with Luke 23.36.</note> ſo as that they may have it for nothing if they will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of it (as the word <hi>given</hi> is many times uſed, As where its ſaid the <hi>Jews</hi> gave Chriſt Vinegar to drink, and he refuſed it, and they gave him gall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) then he gives it to the world, even to others then do accept and receive it, as is ſaid above to <hi>Joh</hi> 6.33. But if we take <hi>give</hi> for ſuch an imparting it, as is accompanied with receiving it, ſo neither we, nor <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.33. ſays, that he gives eternal life to the world, much leſs, as it is in <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.27, 28. he gives it them, and they ſhall never periſh. Could he but have ſhewed us one word to that purpoſe, that the world ſhall never periſh, it had been to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. For <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.13. and 11, 12, 15. we have anſwered them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the precedent Chapter. The falling of the <hi>Jews</hi> is called the <hi>Riches</hi> and <hi>Reconciling</hi> of the world, as the decay of Trade in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Country, and diverting it hither, may be ſaid to be the inriching of this Kingdom. In which the word <hi>Kingdom</hi> may truly fignifie the whole body of the people, though many through idleneſs and rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs in it may deprive themſelves of that inriching which it brought them, or gave them fair advantages of. Beſides, the world, the Nations in general, not the Elect in them onely, were reconciled or taken into ſavor as to the Goſpel-preaching to them, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Kingdom for them, which before they had no ſuch liberty to, but were looked upon as unclean, in reſpect of having the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms outward Ordinances, and Priviledges allowed them, but now were cleanſed by God, and accounted clean as to them; and that alſo was their riches though not the riches of the glory of the Saints, they indeed have yet further riches, even Chriſt in them the hope of glory; which many of the world reconciled as to the former (of which the Apoſtle evidently there ſpeaks, the <hi>Jews</hi> being caſt off from that, and not from inward Union with God which they had
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:117749:118"/>not ever that were broken off) might and did miſs of, by obſerving lying vanities forſaking their own mercies, <hi>Jonas</hi> 2.8. either by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief or negligence in a vain curſory receit of the Ordinances and grace of Reconciliation therein tendered.

                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>ca.</hi> 6.</note> We have before ſpoken to in <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. That of 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. We have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſpoken to largely before in the Chapter about Reconciliation. Onely I ſhall add here, that the word <hi>world</hi> cannot there mean the Elect onely, for then no need of fearing that any toward whom that grace was vouchſafed ſhould receive it in vain, as is intimately feared by the Apoſtle. <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.1.2. As for the Argument uſed from the Non-imputation there ſpoken of, we have ſhewed it to be weak alſo. God reckoned not the ſins of the world to it in that he winked at them, and did not demand ſatisfaction at their hands for them, but preached forgiveneſs to them, which indeed was a very great bleſſing, but it comes to life and happineſs onely upon them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, and believe, as the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6, 7, 9. His reaſons why the Elect ſhould be called the <hi>world,</hi> as they are (eſpecially the three firſt) very ſlender ones, ſo they do all fall to the ground, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it can be firſt proved that it is ſo called.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. His fourth Reaſon is like <hi>Nicodemus's, How can theſe things be?</hi> Why doth not God give the Goſpel to all then? who do any periſh? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He might as well ſay, If God brought <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that they might go to <hi>Canaan,</hi> why did he not make them all truſt in him, and carry them all thither? This is not to believe the VVord of God, that ſays, <hi>Chriſt is the Propitiation for the ſins of the whole world,</hi> &amp;c. But to ſet our Reaſon againſt it, though we could ſay, God hath told us more about his revealing Chriſt then he doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. <hi>viz.</hi> That He is the true Light that inlightneth every man that comesin to the world. But hewil there ſay too (as the manner of our darkneſs and unbelief is at every truth of God that it cannotcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend) <hi>Durus eſt hic ſermo,</hi> How can this be? for he will ſcarce conceive that the Word can ſparkle through the Humanity united to it into the hearts of every man, except the Manhood too be plainly declared, or that that divine being that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are led to ſee in the VVorks of God, is no other then the VVord that was incarnate, and is the true God, this may ſeem as ſtrange to him as that to the <hi>Jews, Before</hi> Abraham <hi>was I Am,</hi> and may meet with as many ſtones
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:117749:119"/>about it. For Truth is full of Paradoxes to the wiſdom of the Fleſh, though plain to him that findes underſtanding. Beſides, God hath ſent his Goſpel to All Nations and Peoples, though many have put the light from them, and choſen darkneſs rather, even whole Countries and Peoples, and therefore ſhall be juſtly condemned, not for that they had it not, but becauſe when God ſent it, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it not, but have from age to age ſlighted and rejected it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He heaps up another neſt of abſurdities upon us. As 1. <q>
                        <hi>That we cannot underſtand this to be All, and Every man, except we grant ſome to be loved &amp; hated from eternity.</hi>
                     </q> But how our granting that ſhould depend upon that large extent of the Word, it will poſe Reaſon it ſelf to conceive, and Scripture too. Sure he meant, Except we deny it, as we do, if by hatred he mean a purpoſe not to ſend his Son for them, without their diſobedience to his Son, and the light ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended through him to condemn and deſtroy them. 2. He ſays, <q>
                        <hi>We muſt make the Love of God toward innumerable to be fruitleſs and vain.</hi>
                     </q> We deny that too. For there-through they injoy their lives, liberties, patience, bounty, goodneſs, hints of truth to their mindes, ſome more, ſome leſs, as he ſees fit in his wiſdom, and God ſhall receive much glory. Though its true (and no abſurdity to ſay) that ſome do reject much grace, or receive it in vain, in regard of many further fruits it would effect, yea, and turn that that was for their welfare into a ſnare. Turning that grace and goodneſs into wantonneſs that ſhould lead them to repentance. <q>3. <hi>That then the Son of God is given to them that never hear word of him, nor have any power to believe.</hi>
                     </q> Anſwer. Its not ſaid, He gave him to the world, but gave him ſimply out of love to the world, and give him he might for them, to whom ſo properly he may not be ſaid to give him. I ſuppoſe you think he was given for, if not alſo to ſome children that die in infancy, and yet they never hear of him, and ſo many former <hi>Jews</hi> might never hear of him diſtinctly as that he ſhould be crucified, and yet they had good by that they heard not of. Death came in upon All through <hi>Adam,</hi> though many never heard of him, and ſo may and doth much mercy by Chriſt to ſuch as never hear diſtinctly of him. And did men in that mercy grope after God (as the Apoſtles ſay) they might haply finde him. What power God gives to men to yield up to the light that comes from him, I cannot ſay for others, I am not in their boſoms, but for my ſelf, I am ſure more then I have acted forth, and followed him in. And that
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:117749:119"/>God gives no power to believe, or at leaſt ſoberly to attend to God that they might be helpt to believe, but onely where men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed do believe, is as inevident, as that God gave not power to <hi>Adam</hi> to forbear eating the forbidden fruit, becauſe he did not forbear. I cannot ſee into thoſe ſecrets, how far God acts, or acts not upon others, but the not ſeeing ſuch ſecrets ſhall be no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to me to wave what is revealed (if not plainly in this, yet) in other Scriptures of larger expreſſion. If Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſee into mens ſpirits, and can tell us what God doth to all, and how far he deals with them, or finds the Scripture expreſſing it, let him demonſtrate to us, that God doth give no power to any to attend to him in the ways wherein he uſeth to beget faith according to the means vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed, but onely to them that are actually brought to faith, and I ſhall liſten to him. 4. He ſays, "<hi>Then God is mutable in his Love.</hi> Anſwer. That follows not, for ſo far as he ſays he loved it, he acted, and never altered it, he did give his <hi>Son</hi> (and never reverſed it) <hi>that whoſoever believes ſhould not periſh,</hi> &amp;c. And yet we being mutable, and corrupting our ſelves, God may ſay to us, as well as to <hi>Ephraim, Hoſ.</hi> 9.15. <hi>I will love them no more,</hi> and yet the alteration in us onely, not in him. The effects of the ſame act may be different to an object without difference in the act, as the ſame ſhine of the Sun may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh a ſound eye, and yet hurt the ſame eye when ſore. 5. Then he ſays, "<hi>He gives not all things to All to whom he gave his Son.</hi> This with the Scripture alledged for it, is once and again anſwered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. "<hi>6. Then he knows not certainly who ſhall believe and be ſaved.</hi> Which no more follows from it, then this, God loved <hi>Iſrael</hi> to bring them out of <hi>Egypt</hi> that he might bring them that followed him into <hi>Canaan:</hi> But he brought not all the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> into <hi>Canaan, Ergo,</hi> If he brought all the <hi>Iſraelits</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> he knew not who would believe in him, and follow him into <hi>Canaan.</hi> What a piece of Non-ſenſe is ſuch an Inference? But againſt the inlarging of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, he further thus reaſons from the next particular, <hi>[That who ſo believes]</hi> thus</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>If the object be reſtrained there to believers, then that depends upon the will of God, or upon themſelves, If upon themſelves, That con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts,</hi> 1. Cor. 1.7. <hi>and men make themſelves to differ. If upon God, then we make the place ſay thus, God ſo loved All, that but ſome ſhould partake of the fruits of his Love, and to what end then did he love All? Is not this Out with the Sword, and run the Dragon
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:117749:120"/>through with the Spear?</hi>
                     </q> To which I anſwer, That the ſecond act, the giving the injoyment of eternal life, is here aſſerted but for them that believe; and both the appointing life to the believer, and the effecting of that faith depend upon Gods Will. As we can make no Law upon what terms to have that life, So neither can we work in our ſelves that condition upon which God giveth that life. Faith is the gift of God.
<note place="margin">Acts 28.26, 27. with Joh. 12.40.</note> Yet this latter is ſo of God, as that it is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome actings of man, to which he exhorts men, and for want of which he juſtly faults them, yea brings them not to faith. Its by mans hearing, though not of mans power. Whence, though one man liſten to the means, and is brought to believe, and another that had as much power to have liſtened, ſtop his ear, and believes not; yet it follows not that the firſt made himſelf to differ, becauſe not his liſtening, but God by it gave the faith; no more then one <hi>Iſraelite</hi> looking to the braſen Serpent, &amp; being healed, might be ſaid to have made himſelf to differ from another that looked not up in point of healing, in which they had both yet remained alike, had not God given healing to the one, and not to the other. The imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of the Allegation of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. I ſhewed before. Nor yet follows that other Inference, That its but thus, <hi>God loved All</hi> that but ſome might partake of the fruits of his love, For 1. There are other fruits then eternal life, of which all partake. 2. There is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of any from that condition by which we may partake of that. When he ſays, <hi>That every one that believes,</hi> Its to incourage all to believe, not to hinder any. The whole Argument is but like this. God brought <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that he might bring them that obeyed and followed him into <hi>Canaan.</hi> Either that reſtriction was determined by Gods Will, or their own. If their own, then they made themſelves differ one from another, contrary to the Apoſtle. If by Gods, then the ſenſe is, He brought all out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that he might bring but ſome into <hi>Canaan.</hi> To what end then, I pray, did he bring All out of <hi>Egypt?</hi> Is not this, Out with the Sword, and run the Dragon through with the Spear? Is not this folly and ſoppery thus to reaſon, or from ſuch a reaſon to deny the Truth of Gods Word, and ſay, God ſurely did not bring any out of <hi>Egypt</hi> but whom he brought into <hi>Canaan.</hi> Or will he aſcribe <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhuah's</hi> faith more to will, then the believing that which is atteſted by the VVord of God (or by the powerful working of miracles, or the like) is the Truth of God?</p>

                        <hi>Ay, But if believers onely be the object that ſhall have ſalvation, Then the general ranſom is an empty ſound.</hi>
                     </q> Anſwer. It is ſo to Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, as God himſelf is in reſpect of that infinite ſatisfaction that is in him, and ſo was Gods bringing <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> to them that believed not. Such is the pernicious nature of Unbelief, that it turns wholſom food into poyſon, but to ſuch as have learned to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come fools, that God might make them wiſe, to thoſe that learn to ſubject their reaſon to Gods Truth, its not ſo, for they finde it a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to draw them in to believe in God, and to admire his Love to men, and the depth of his judgments towards them; yea, in a word, to teach them to deny ungodlineſs, and live godlily, as <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12. And they finde it a very wholſom uſeful Truth to hold forth to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to let them ſee cauſe for believing in God, and hoping in him, and to charge them with folly and madneſs, that having ſuch ground to believe yet refuſe it. The moſt pretious Truth that is, is an empty found in reſpect of ſpiritual good to the Unbeliever. Shal we conclude, <hi>Ergo,</hi> its a falſhood? Gods goodneſs it ſelf that lead men to Repentance is an empty thing to thoſe that harden themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, and brings them to no ſpiritual good or happineſs, ſhall we therefore teach men to ſay God is good to none but them that rightly uſe his goodneſs and receive the fruit of it in life eternal? Is not this to teach men to deſpiſe the riches of Gods goodneſs? O the blindeneſs of our reaſon in the things of God, &amp; the folly of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it as Umpire in matters of our faith, waving the Word of God that ſhould rightly guide us. But yet this let me ſay, Unbelievers ſhall ſee, and finde one day, that this general ranſom was no empty thing in it ſelf, it was meerly their folly and wickedneſs that made it ſo to them, and then it ſhall be full of dread and terror to them that they have denied him that bought them. His premiſes being ſuch humane miſtakes, high thoughts lifted up, and ſtrengthned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Scripture-Declaration, his Concluſion, that Chriſt died not, or God gave not his Son for them that believe not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> falls with them, They being notable juſtifications of all Unbelievers, and Patronizers of ſlothfulneſs, from which theſe things follow: That to Unbelievers God was not an object meet to be believed on by them, nor had any reall reaſon to love him, they being ever hated by him, and he never doing them any good in his Son. That the want of faith was no fault of theirs, for they could no way have avoided what they did in not believing, God neither gave them
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:117749:121"/>cauſe nor grace to believe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I ſhall rake no further in ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean a dunghill, that ſavors ſo much of Satan, and juſtifies the caſe of all Unbelievers.</p>

                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IN his third Chapter he proceeds to another inſtance of Scripture for us, <hi>viz.</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.2. <hi>He is the propitiation for our ſins, and not for our ſins onely, but alſo for the ſins of the whole world.</hi> Urged by us both from the plain full expreſſion, which (except in oppoſition to ſome called out of the world) always ſignifies <hi>All men, the world,</hi> and then <hi>All men,</hi> beſides thoſe ſpoken of, with, or oppoſed to it when ſo joyned. And 2. From its oppoſition here to believers, or ſpeaking of it as a diſtinct party beyond them. To paſs by his frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous expoſition of men living in all parts of the world, which is as good as nothing by way of oppoſition to us, That expreſſion reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to All men in the world, except it were bounded with ſome li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, as onely ſome of all ſorts living in All places. And then we challenge him to ſhew us the words, <hi>whole world,</hi> ſo taken in any divine expreſſion. I ſhall view his more ſerious reply conſiſting of an indeavor to do theſe three things. <q>1. <hi>Clear it to whom the Apoſtle writ.</hi> 2. <hi>What his purpoſe and aim in this place is,</hi> 3. <hi>What the meaning of Chriſts being a propitiation is, and what he means by the whole world.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the firſt, he ſaith, <q>
                        <hi>This Epiſtle was peculiarly directed to the</hi> Jews.</q> But he holds in his proof of it. For 1. <q>
                        <hi>He confeſſes he hath nothing in the Epiſtle that nominates them to whom he writ it, to make the aſſertion infallibly true,</hi>
                     </q> de fide; and ſo what he can ſay is no matter of faith, nor ſufficient ground of limiting what what is evidently propounded in it to our faith. Onely he brings probabilities (as he calls them) that it was intended to the <hi>Jews</hi> (to them onely he muſt mean, or he ſays nothing to the purpoſe) they are theſe four.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>1. <hi>That John was one of them that was to preach to the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion with</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> James, <hi>Now they writ to the</hi> Jews, Ergo,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:117749:121"/>John <hi>alſo.</hi>
                     </q> I anſwer, Whether by the twelve Tribes, and the ſtrangers ſcattered abroad, <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> mean the <hi>Jews</hi> onely, is queſtionable, ſeeing the place where the ten Tribes were carried was ſcarcely then known, nor yet is. And beſides, the Chriſtians are taken into their place and made one body with them, and I ſuppoſe are by our Saviour meant to be the twelve Tribes, when he ſays, The Apoſtles ſhall ſit on twelve Thrones judging the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael, Matth.</hi> 19.28. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.30. And the Chriſtians were ſtrangers to the world more then the ſcattered <hi>Jews,</hi> even the <hi>Gentile Chriſtians</hi> alſo becauſe of their converſation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.3, 4. And ſure that in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.10. Sometimes not a people, but now a people, agrees rather to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> then the <hi>Jews.</hi> Again, We finde <hi>Paul</hi> was one of them that was to preach to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the prime of them, and yet its ſuppoſed he wrote to the <hi>Jews</hi> the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> However, that he preached often to them is manifeſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So <hi>John,</hi> though firſtly, he was to preach to the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet did take care of the ſeven <hi>Aſian Churches,</hi> and living after all the reſt of the Apoſtles took care of all the Churches as an Apoſtle, and its moſt probable that he writ to them all too; his Epiſtle being Catholike, that is, univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, and without any particular limitation and inſcription to any Church, or any ſort of believers more then them of <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> were. Yea, he inſcribes it to believers indefinitly, not to <hi>Jew</hi>-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.13. <hi>Theſe things have I written to you that believe,</hi> He ſays not, to you that are believing <hi>Jews,</hi> or the like, but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Believers then, as ſuch, and ſo all ſuch, are thoſe he directed it to, that they might know that they have eternal life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that there is more probability, yea, more from the very letter of the Epiſtle, againſt his conceit, then for it. But</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He tells us, <q>John <hi>frequently intimates, that thoſe he wrote to received the Word from the beginning. Now the</hi> Jews <hi>had it firſt preached to them.</hi>

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:117749:122"/>Goſpels being preached to them, They ſhould not think they preached one to them at firſt, but now (as ſome falſe Apoſtles would perſwade them, and as many Deceivers would do believers now) that its neceſſary that they ſhould have ſome other Doctrine then that at firſt preached to them, ſome higher things then the Goſpel contains, new things that they never heard of before; no, ſays he, its but the ſame, as in <hi>ver.</hi> 24. <hi>Let that therefore which ye have heard from the beginning abide in you,</hi> Let not that ſlip, thoſe firſt foundamental Truths,
<note place="margin">With that alſo in Revel. 2.24, 25. and 3.3.</note> and if that abide in you that ye heard from the beginning, ye ſhall abide in the Father and in the Son.

                  <p>
                     <q>3. <hi>He argues from the oppoſition between us and the world, as a</hi> Jew <hi>reckoning himſelf with the</hi> Jews, <hi>in oppoſition to the reſt of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in the world,</hi>
                     </q> Which he thinks is enough alone to manifeſt whom he wrote to. But this is the moſt improbable of all the reſt, as if the Apoſtle writing to all believers would not reckon himſelf one with them, whether <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile,</hi> but keep open yet the old diſtinction, which the Goſpel came to take away. Again, How uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all was it with Chriſt, ſpeaking to believing diſciples of the <hi>Jews,</hi> onely to oppoſe them to the world, and by the world to mean un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing <hi>Jews</hi> alſo? as in <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.19. and 7.7. and 17.14. So <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> as to the <hi>Corinths,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.30. oppoſes the world to believers of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and by the world means all final un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers, <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile.</hi> Nay, if this had any force, then in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.19. he ſhould ſtrengthen the <hi>Jew</hi> in their obſtanacy (which
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:117749:122"/>he ſays they had) againſt the Churches of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> for there he oppoſes himſelf and thoſe he wrote to, to the whole world beſides, in like manner as here. We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in wickedneſs. Now if he writ as a <hi>Jew,</hi> reckoning with the <hi>Jews,</hi> and ſet himſelf with them in oppoſition to All other belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in the world, then he ſays there, That he and the believing <hi>Jews</hi> were of God, but all the Churches of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> lay in the wicked one. And who would not abominate ſuch an Expoſition? Nay, Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſhould do well to finde any one place in all the Scripture, where the word <hi>world</hi> (ſpecially ſpoken of with diſtinction from believers or any ſort or Nation) fignifies another ſort or kinde of believers. So that thats vain too.</p>
                  <p>His laſt is, <q>
                        <hi>His mentioning and given cautions of Deceivers, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers, Antichriſts,</hi> &amp;c.</q> As if any man that mindes the Scriptures could be ignorant that theſe kinde of people did peſter alſo the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi> Churches, as the <hi>Galathians, Corinthians,</hi> Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> &amp;c. And that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was as circumſpect of the <hi>Gentile</hi> Churches, and as careful to preſerve them from theſe Seducers as poſſibly could be, and ſo that <hi>John</hi> living after the reſt of the Apoſtles needed as much to war and watch over them as an other Churches. Nay, he that ſhall equally weigh things will ſay, there was more need for them then others, becauſe they receiving the Goſpel from the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Deceivers of the <hi>Jews</hi> had more influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon them then upon their own Churches, for they were apt to queſtion <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine upon this ground, that others of the <hi>Jews</hi> that pretended Authority from the Apoſtles taught otherwiſe. Beſides, that the great ſtumble of the falſe Apoſtles was in the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi> Churches, that they wanted Circumciſion which the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Churches wanted not: to ſay nothing that we finde them troubling the <hi>Gentiles</hi> often, but never that they troubled with ſuch Doctrines the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Churches, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.3, 4, 5.23, 24. So that I ſhall need to ſay no more to that firſt Conſideration, having undermined it, and made it unable to afford that patronage to his Gloſs that he puts upon it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the ſcope and aim of the Apoſtle. <q>
                        <hi>It is,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to give conſolation to believers againſt their ſins and failings. If any man ſin we have an advocate,</hi> &amp;c.</q> But herein alſo he comes ſhort. For though 1. I grant that he writ to comfort believers, all or any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and not believing <hi>Jews</hi> onely, and that that was his main aim,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:117749:123"/>yet it was not all; for 2. He affords them alſo a Direction in caſe of other men, to improve their intereſt in their Advocate by Prayers, Interceſſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for them according to <hi>Pauls</hi> direction to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thence its to be noted, That he ſays not, If any of you ſin, but indefinitely, If any ſin. But ſuppoſe he aim onely at the comfort of believers, what then? He adds, <q>
                        <hi>Then he can ſpeak of none but them onely, and that the extending it to All, can poſſibly make nothing to the end propoſed, namely, the Conſolation of believers.</hi>
                     </q> But ſure he is out here. For the conſideration that Chriſt renders God propitious to ſtrangers (ſuch his power and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency with him) is an argument much conducing to perſwade them, that he will render him much more propitious to his children that are wounded for their follies, and fly to him. And I conceive the Apoſtle may be underſtood ſo to ſpeak in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. <hi>He that ſpared not his own Son, but gave him up for us All,</hi> That is, for us All men, one and other, <hi>how ſhall he not with him</hi> (having given him to us alſo, as <hi>Beza</hi> notes on the place) <hi>give <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s</hi> (that is, his choſen ones) <hi>All things?</hi> He that doth good to good and bad, to them that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, and ill-requiting, will not he do good to us that love him, and are born of him? Surely if this afford no comfort, I know not what will. Nay, I ſee nothing in the Text aggravate the conſolation more then this. Its like that in <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.26, 28. <hi>He feeds the Fowls of the Air, and clothes the Lillies, how much more you his children?</hi> So here Chriſt is free for All to come to God by, how much more you that have believed and are his peculiarly. He procures that gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs, and kindneſs or mercy, be extended to the whole world, how much more to you his choice Inheritance? Thats the very voice of unbelief that counts this light <hi>Manna,</hi> and retorts the Argument, as Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> doth. <q>
                        <hi>They periſh moſt of them through unbelief, ſo may I too.</hi>
                     </q> So might the Diſciples have retorted; Ah Lord, but many of the fowls of heaven are taken and kill'd, and periſh for want of food, and ſo may we do too. The Argument is ſtrengthned from that, If God care for Birds, made to be taken, and killed, and for Lillies that fade, and are caſt into the Oven, much more for you that are his children ordained to an eternal inheritance. So, If the world, many of whom yet periſh, finde Chriſt ready to do them good, till they have made themſelves void of all excuſe, and hardned their hearts againſt him, much more will he be ready to accept us, and paſs by our offences who believe on him. Yea, if their periſhing
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:117749:123"/>is for their unbelief, and they might be brought into ſpecial favor did they believe, what cauſe have we to believe on him, and not let go our belief! And yet in this the Apoſtle doth no more throw the conſolation of believers to Dogs, then Chriſt did throw the conſolation of his Diſciples to the fowls, or then <hi>James</hi> doth the believers conſolation to Dogs, in <hi>James</hi> 1.5. Nor is Chriſts dying for men, the childrens proper portion; thats yet to prove, but the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Priviledges of Chriſt in the injoyment of God, which we do not throw to any Dogs, which yet men are not accounted as meerly natural, but as Rebels againſt the grace of God, proud ſcorners, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.8. except it be by ſome conceited <hi>Jew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Nay, the Apoſtle intimates, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26.29. That they that had the ſacrifice of Chriſt offered up for them, and the blood of it in ſome ſenſe ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying them,

It ſeems there was one, even that of Chriſt for them before, The Propitiatory Sacrifice did indeed expiate ſin, and reconciled legally the perſon to God when it was accompanied with Faith in him that brought it, or for whom it was offered, or with a ſubmiſſion unto God according to Law; and ſo the comers to this Sacrifice of Chriſt, have all thoſe effects by him enumerated to perfection, but not all for whom it was offered, or for whom he is a Propitiation. 3. A Propitiation he is for them all in this, That by his offering of himſelf, he is that Thing or Perſon unto which God having reſpect is propitious or favorable to them, deals not with the world according to their deſerts, but is patient and bountiful to them, delights not that any periſh, but that all ſhould rather come to Repentance, unto which his goodneſs and patience alſo leadeth. As alſo in this, that Chriſt is He that hath done ſo much in his Death, and Mediation for the world, that he is ſet before it in the Goſpel as a mean of reconciliation, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance into the favor of God, he is free for the whole world to come to God by, and any perſon of it may finde favor with God through him. Yea, 4. The ſin of the world, even of <hi>Adam,</hi> and all in him, is ſo covered or expiated by his Death and Sacrifice, that God took not the forfeiture of our lives according to the deſert thereof, out of reſpect to him, but in that ſenſe (at leaſt,) juſtification of life is to all: both a being under mercy here, and away to life for us in Chriſt for hereafter. That Law I finde not (I mean the Law inflicting death upon <hi>Adam</hi> and all his Poſterity for eating the forbidden fruit) ſhall be produced againſt any as the cauſe of perpetual ruine. Yea, that the whole world through this Sacrifice of Chriſt are brought neer to God, the Kingdom expoſed to them, and no man
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:117749:124"/>to be called common or unclean as formerly (So as upon that ground its unlawful for him to enter it,) we have ſhewed before,

And I deſire him to prove, that the words <hi>whole world</hi> when diſtinguiſhed from believers doth not ſignifie all the reſt, and with them make All and every man.

                     </q> I Anſwer, In themſelves they are, but they may be otherwiſe uſed. This is to fly from the terms, not to explain them, to tell us what other words ſignifie, not that thats ſpoken to: and yet in his Inſtances of the uſe of thoſe words in the Propheſies, there is this diſparity which he conſiders not, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>whole world</hi> is ſpoken of as a diſtinct party from (and a party reaching beyond) thoſe that are clearly ſpoken of as believers, beyond the <hi>we</hi> that walk in the light, confeſs our ſins, that have an Advocate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 
                     <q>But <hi>in thoſe Inſtances, That All fleſh ſhall ſee the ſalvation of God, All the ends of the earth ſhall remember and to turn to God, He will pour out his Spirit upon All fleſh,</hi> &amp;c.</q> There is in none of them places ſuch a diſtinction, as ſpeaking of a party at preſent exiſting beyond thoſe that are believers.

Though I believe all of them ſhall not be through with Chriſt and his people, for after a thouſand years Satan ſhall deceive many multitudes of them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.8, 9. Yea, then alſo ſhall the Spirit be poured upon all fleſh, the power and breath of God ſhall in abundance be upon it, to abaſe and confound it, not to make all fleſh grow and be admired, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, and do wonders, but then ſhall the ſons and daughters of Sion propheſie. It ſhall be a ſpirit of Propheſie upon them; but he ſays not ſo to all fleſh upon whom its poured. So that thoſe may be taken in the fulleſt latitude of thoſe times, and of thoſe ages pointed at chiefly, without any error I conceive. The Spirit of the Lord ſhall breathe upon all fleſh and make it wither, as in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 40.6, 7. And in the children of Sion it ſhall be a ſpirit of Propheſie. Now whereas its ſaid, that that was fulfilled in the day of Pentecoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. I anſwer, Propheſies of that nature have a twofold fulfilling. 1. In a firſt-fruits, ſo it was then, and ſince in its meaſure in the Churches. 2. Fully, in the full accompliſhment of them, and then it ſhall have its latitude and extent. Again. 2. When its ſaid, This is that ſpoken of by ſuch a Prophet, its not always meant, this is the full accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:117749:125"/>of that, or the thing primely pointed at there, but this is of the nature of that, as in <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.17. The weeping of the <hi>Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiſh</hi> mothers for their children kill'd by <hi>Herod,</hi> was as that ſpoken of by <hi>Jeremy, Chap.</hi> 31. There was then ſuch a weeping as was there ſpoken of. But yet to any Reader its evident, that the Prophet <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy</hi> aimed not primely at that, but at the carrying away of the <hi>Ephramites</hi> deſcended of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and ſo of <hi>Rachel.</hi> Thence that promiſe in the next <hi>verſe,</hi> They ſhall come again from the land of the Enemy. So that in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. was a pouring out of the Spirit to abaſe the fleſh, and a giving them to Propheſie, as was ſpoken of in <hi>Joel,</hi> though <hi>Joels</hi> eye pierced further then that very pouring it out upon thoſe perſons in that manner, and thoſe preſent inſuing effects. <q>
                        <hi>That All the Nations ſhall be believers, I grant, and then the whole world, ye all that believe ſhall have little difference, and ſo much thoſe places, and that of</hi> Iſai. 2.2. <hi>will hold forth.</hi>
                     </q> But that the <hi>whole world,</hi> now or in <hi>Johns</hi> time, were ſo, or that the words <hi>whole world</hi> diſtinguiſhed from believers, who have Chriſt a propitiation, ſignifies onely believers: I deny the former, as evidently falſe, and the latter as a groundleſs conceit.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He reaſons thus. <q>
                        <hi>The words</hi> whole world <hi>ſignifies ſometimes the worſer part of the world, and why may it not then the better?</hi>
                     </q> To which I anſwer, that the word <hi>world</hi> hath reaſon when diſtinguiſhed from men called out of the world, and oppoſed to them, to ſignifie the worſer part, becauſe diſtinguiſhed from the better. But why when diſtinguiſhed from the better, it ſhould ſignifie the better, I know none. I ask him why in that caſe it muſt not ſignifie the worſe too. Now here its manifeſtly extended beyond the better part, Us that have an Advocate, and not for us onely, but for the whole world. If he could finde me any place where its diſtinguiſhed from a bad party, as bad as any can be, there we might allow it happily ſo to ſignifie rather then here. After theſe conſiderations (and from them) he mentions ſome ſmall reaſons which are all ſpoken to in what is ſaid already, except the firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>That he ſpeaks not of Impetration, but of Application, but none ever ſaid that the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the death of Chriſt is univerſal.</hi>
                     </q> To which I anſwer, That what ever it ſpeaks of, its Vniverſal; we muſt not ſquare the Scripture to our ſpeakings, but our ſpeakings to the Scriptures. 2. Its not ſpoken here of the application of Chriſts Death by Faith, but of what Chriſts death doth with God for All
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:117749:126"/>men, or rather what Chriſt is with God for them, by vertue of it, not what Chriſt doth in men, nor the fruits that follow upon this Propitiation believed in by men, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. doth. This Scripture, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.2. tells us what Chriſt is with God for All the world, that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. tells us how God propounds him to men in the Goſpel, and what he is to become to them by Faith, and what benefit they ſhall receive. There is the mercy Seat, here the atoning Sacrifice, as here conſidered he keeps off many a blow from All, as there propounded and received by Faith he brings to us remiſſion of all, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> His other Reaſons and Reaſonings being fore-ſpoken to, I paſs.</p>
                  <p>He is out again about 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. when he tells us, <q>
                        <hi>That the world that God was reconciling</hi> (ver. 19.) <hi>was the</hi> Us <hi>that he recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled and put the word of Reconciliation into the hearts of</hi> (ver. 18.)</q> [that is indeed the Apoſtles and Preachers of the Goſpel onely] which is ſo evidently falſe, that it needs no other anſwer then the noting of it. For why doth the Apoſtle exhort others ſtill to be reconciled, and ſtile themſelves the Ambaſſadors of God for that, if the <hi>World</hi> that God was Reconciling was only the Ambaſſadors of Reconciliation? His confounding <hi>[hath reconciled us by Chriſt]</hi> and <hi>[was reconciling the World in Chriſt]</hi> deſerves not looking on, the reſt we have ſpoken to. Onely where he ſaith, <q>
                        <hi>That</hi> [God was in Chriſt reconciling] <hi>holdeth out an actual work of Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and muſt be either Conditional or Abſolute.</hi>
                     </q> I anſwer, What God hath done already is abſolute, but the Reconciliation to be accompliſhed on mens part, and in men, is conditional, and the actual reconciling on Gods part, and tendring the accompliſhment of it in men on condition, are competible enough, as Gods actual leading <hi>Iſrael</hi> towards <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the tendring to bring them into <hi>Canaan</hi> conditionally to many individuals were. But then he asks, <q>
                        <hi>What is that condition?</hi>
                     </q> I anſwer, That they liſten to, and cordially receive the grace of God. But then he ſays, <q>
                        <hi>The words muſt ſignifie either that God was reconciling a believing world, or an unbelieving world.</hi>
                     </q> I anſwer, Neither, properly, for the world could be looked upon as neither (if he mean of believing in, or unbelief of Chriſt) as God was laying its ſins on Chriſt, and puniſhing him for it, and preparing means to reveal his goodneſs to them; for till there be an object of Faith, vertually, or actually fitted for our faith to lean on, and till that be diſcovered, the world is not chargeable with unbelief in it,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:117749:126"/>nor can believe on it. It was a <hi>world</hi> at enmity with God, and not believing (yea without any known ground of believing) in him, till the revelation of Gods goodneſs to them come unto them. His <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma</hi> was anſwered long before.</p>

                     </q> but I deſire his proof for it, for the Apoſtle intimates that ſome might poſſibly receive that grace in vain, and ſo not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled. Whereas in anſwer to <hi>T. More.</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>He asks if all the Elect are not men.</hi>
                     </q> I anſwer, that that was not queſtioned, but whether the Apoſtle ſaying, that he perſwaded men, meant that he perſwaded the Elect only, or others? Whereas <hi>T. More</hi> ſaith, That 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18. ſaith, that ſome of thoſe men were reconciled to God for whom Chriſt died. "<hi>Mr.</hi> Owen <hi>ſaith its moſt falſe.</hi> But ſure he knows not what he ſays, if he ſay that 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18. ſays, That all that Chriſt died for were reconciled, or that the Apoſtle in that verſe ſpeaks not but of ſome, namely, themſelves that were employed to preach to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as alſo if he affirm that all them that the Apoſtle perſwaded, were in their firſt perſwading reconciled.</p>
                  <p>He tells us <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. may be read thus, <q>
                        <hi>The true light is that that coming into the world inlightneth every man.</hi>
                     </q> But thats not much ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, for it muſt needs come before it inlighten. The matter is, that it inlightens every man. Now to ſay that this is every man that is inlightned, a Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſaith, is to leave the matter ſpoken of wholly uncertain, for that may be All, or None, or the Moſt, or the Feweſt. Upon this his note he might have put that obſervation, [viz. "<hi>That ſome corrupt the Scriptures</hi>] better then where he put it.

If he will make his ſaying to be Goſpel, he muſt pull down the ſayings of the Apoſtle, and the Goſpel he preached, and make that no Goſpel, and thoſe expreſſions to be dangerous and erroneous; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he durſt not do, in direct oppoſition to him (as he is bold to do againſt us) therefore he indeavors ſubtly to undermine the Apoſtles expreſſions; telling us, That <q>
                        <hi>no ſtrength of Argument can be taken from the words themſelves, that ſo generally expreſs the matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the word All is often taken for fewer then every man in the World.</hi>
                     </q> Now that the word All is ſometimes ſo taken, I grant, that is, in places where reference is had in it to particular Nations, Countries, Families, ſocieties, &amp;c. in which the foregoing paſſages ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that the writer ſpeaks not of all the world, or of men indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely, as alſo in certain Hiſtorical narrations of mens ſayings, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times when the things ſpoken of, are the actions, councels &amp; paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of men; In which places yet it ſignifies, the Generality or Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality of men in thoſe places, parts, ſocieties, &amp;c. or ſo far as the actions, ſpeeches, and carriages of men may reach. Of this nature are, <hi>All ſhall know that ye are my Diſciples. Provide things honeſt in the ſight of all men. Ye are our Epiſtle, read and known of all men.</hi> All took <hi>John</hi> to be a Prophet, <hi>All</hi> Judea <hi>went out to</hi> John <hi>to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, &amp;c.</hi> But that ever the Scripture ſpeaking of God and his actions, thoughts, will, knowledg toward men, uſes the expreſſion <hi>All men</hi> (without ſome particular reference to ſome particular place, Country, or Kingdom only ſpoken of or to) and therein means few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then all Generally or Univerſally, much leſs that he thereby ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the Elect or Believers, or the like, I do deny, till I can ſee ſomething brought to convince me otherwiſe, eſpecially in Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:117749:127"/>and fundamental truths; ſuch as the Creation, Redemption, Reſurrection, and Judgment are. And I conceive in ſuch caſes, its not ground ſufficient to ſtraighten and limit our faith about a truth ſo expreſſed; (no other Scripture denying it of any, or reſtraining it only to ſome) that theſe general expreſſions in places not Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical, or not ſpeaking of the actions, thoughts, &amp;c. of God toward men, but of mens ſayings, actions, &amp;c. (whoſe abilities are of leſſer circumference) ſignify leſs then All Univerſally. I think by Mr. <hi>Owens</hi> Rules, the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> argued very fallaciouſly, when from the word <hi>All,</hi> (the very word excepted againſt) he thus argues, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Thou haſt put all things under his feet. In that he put all things under him, he left nothing not put under him.</hi> To this Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> might as well except, and ſay, That follows not; for the word <hi>All things,</hi> doth not ſignify Univerſally and collectively, but only ſome things of all ſorts, and ſometimes only the elect and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leivers. Now if the Apoſtle ſo reaſon in that Doctrinal expreſſion, in things attributed to God as the Agent, I would fain ſee ſome reaſon why alſo we may not infer from this, <hi>He gave himſelf a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome for all men, Ergo,</hi> He left out no man from his ranſome-giving. If he anſwer, we do not ſee all men ranſomed, we might reply in the Apoſtles words, neither do we yet ſee all things put under him. Our ſight or not ſeeing of things, is no ſufficient ground of denying credit to Gods ſayings. But I paſs on to view Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> in what follows, in which firſt, <q>
                        <hi>He falls upon the conſideration of</hi> 1 Tim. 2.4. <hi>God wills all men to be ſaved; in which he conſiders,</hi> 1. <hi>What is that will of God there ſpoken of.</hi> 2. <hi>Who are the All of whom the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle is there treating. To the firſt he ſays, The will of God is taken either for the will of God intending, or will commanding and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and wiſhes us to take our option of what we will underſtand it.</hi>
                     </q> To that I anſwer, That of his will intending to effect their ſalvation, I do not underſtand it (if by ſaving we mean in eternal life, otherwiſe I may) the form of ſpeech is paſſive; not, God will ſave all men, or God purpoſes and determines to ſave all men: but God wills all men to be ſaved. Nor is it, God will bring all men to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the truth, but God wills that (or would have) all men come to the knowledg of the Truth, and in ſuch like ſpeeches the word ſignifies, its deſirable, or approved of God, that all men be ſaved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He hath provided a <hi>medium</hi> by which they might, and he deſires that they would be ſaved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as in <hi>Pſa.</hi> 81. <hi>Oh that my

Iſa.</hi> 48.17. <hi>Oh that thou hadſt hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened to my Commandements!</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> 19.41. <hi>Oh that thou hadſt known, at leaſt in this thy day, &amp;c.</hi> and 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to Repentance,</hi> according to that <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.11. <hi>As I live, I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, but rather that he ſhould turn and live.</hi> And ſo the word <gap reason="foreign">

So we take it here to ſignify <hi>volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem beneplaciti,</hi> Its good in his ſight that All be ſaved. And thence he commands All every where to repent, and to look to him and be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. <q>
                        <hi>Now to this he replies, that then this All, can be no more then to whom he granteth the means of grace, which are indeed a great many but not the hundreth part of the poſterity of</hi> Adam.</q> But here,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I deny his inference. <hi>He approves the ſalvation of Infants, that have not thoſe means of grace he ſpeaks of.</hi> 2. We ſay, that thoſe that have the moſt full means of grace, are others then Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> bounds it up to, ſo that yet his expoſition is untrue. 3. We ſay with the Apoſtle, that God created all Nations, that is, <hi>Adam</hi> and all his poſterity, to ſeek after him, and wills them to feel after him, from any one of whom he is not far off; yea, he hath granted the knowledg of truth, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18.) as the words are here, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>) to all the Heathen, debarring none of them from it, but would have them acknowledg what they ſee, and not ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as they do. Yea, he hath ſent out his Goſpel to them all, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them all to come to that, though many have rejected it, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one another from coming to it.
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.23.</note> Now whereas he ſays, <hi>That "ſtream of light which the Gentiles have about God, cannot ſave them;</hi> So I ſay of the Scriptures too of themſelves: but he from whom that light comes, and to whom it leads, is able to ſave them, and the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is his power to ſalvation to them that believe it: and he would have all look to him and grope after him, by what they have, and let him alone with what follows: And though Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> tells us, "<hi>that it will not follow from thence, that Chriſt dyed for All;</hi> yet I
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:117749:128"/>conceive it doth; God never commanding any to look to him and be ſaved, or never approving any mans ſaving, (ſo far as I can find) but in, and by the vertue of a Mediators Death, it being point-blank contrary to the rule of his juſtice, to ſave a condemned man upon whom he hath pronounced Death, without ſatisfaction by Chriſt.

                        <hi>That it ſeems to him exceeding clear, that his efficacious will is here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,</hi> viz. <hi>the will of his purpoſe, and that its here affirmed that he will ſave All,</hi>

                     </gap>, <hi>who will ſave all men.</hi> I would wiſh Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> who is ſo laviſh in his expreſſions againſt others pretended ſorry and irrational dealing (as he ſhews himſelf to be <hi>cha.</hi> 6.) would put on his Spectacles, and minde well what he affirms as truth when he writes again, for as he falſifies the affirmation, ſo he indeavors to confirm his conception by a ſorry argument, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>That the purpoſe of God ſhould be the bottom of our prayers, which contradicts his former pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious conſideration, cap.</hi> 1.</q> where he aſſerts that between Gods purpoſe and our duty there is no connexion: And againſt the practice of the Saints, as of <hi>Jeremy,</hi> who prayed for a people that God determied to deſtroy, and give over to their enemies. And contrary to our Saviour, who prayed the Cup might paſs from him, though he ſubmitted himſelf to his Fathers Will. Its enough that we do what God bids us, and what he tells us its acceptable to him though we know not his purpoſes. If he approve all mens being ſaved, and coming to the knowledg of Truth, thats ground enough for our ſo deſiring too, and furthering it what we can. So <hi>Pauls</hi> deſire and prayer for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> were, that they might be ſaved, even them whom he generally ſays of, that they were blinded, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.1, 2. and 11.5, 6. His Premiſes being ſo faulty, his Concluſion muſt needs be untrue, viz. <q>
                        <hi>That all men then muſt be ſaved, if by all men be meant every man in the world.</hi>
                     </q> To the conſideration of which words he nextly proceedeth.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <q>2. <hi>By All men</hi> (he ſays) <hi>the Apoſtle intends all ſorts of men indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely living under the Goſpel, or under the inlarged diſpenſation of the means of grace.</hi>
                     </q> That this is in it no man (I think) will deny, but that this is all the truth of it, I expect he ſhould confirm; but in coming over it again he ſays, "<hi>That by all men is meant, only of all
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:117749:129"/>ſorts of men, that is, but ſome of all ſorts;</hi> Which is larger then the former expreſſion in this, that, before he confined it to men living under the Goſpel, now to all ſorts indefinitely; for indeed there is a ſort of men, that through their own former wickedneſs, or others ſlothfulneſs, have not the Goſpel now preached to them as we have, as the <hi>Indians, &amp;c.</hi> which here he may ſeem to include too; and then this latter expreſſion contradicts the former; but ſcanter in this, that he ſaid before, all ſorts of men, which might reach to all of all ſorts. Now its but of all ſorts, that is, but ſome of all; which he endeavors thus to confirm.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <q>
                        <hi>That the word All moſt uſually ſignifies in Scripture many of all ſorts, and therefore it muſt do ſo here too.</hi>
                     </q> To this I anſwer. 1. That his Propoſition is falſe, Where it ſignifies many of all ſorts onely in Scripture once, it ſignifies all of all ſorts of thoſe things whereabout the word is uſed twenty times. And this I will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to make good againſt him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In thoſe very places he propounds to ſhew, that it ſo ſignifies, he doth but <hi>Petere principium.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. I ſay, That when it ſpeaks of the actions of God towards men, or of his purpoſes, thoughts, knowledg, or the like, it very fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, if ever, ſignifies in any other place (but many of all ſorts) but all generally or univerſally, if the ſpeech be not bound up to ſome particular Place or Countrey. Beſides,</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Did it ſo elſewhere, it would not follow It muſt do ſo here too. "Whereas he ſays, <q>
                        <hi>There is nothing to impel another ſignification thats larger.</hi>
                     </q> I anſwer, yes, This, that its laid down as a ground of praying for all men. Now we are not to limit our prayers to ſome of all ſorts, for then we ſhould be ready to ſay, though we refuſe to pray for ſuch and ſuch as we have not ſeen ſin to death, yet we have done our duty. Yea, though we pray but for them all that ſeem to be of our minde of all ſorts, for then we might ſay we have prayed for ſome of all ſorts, &amp; thats all thats required: however, in praying for the Church only, we might ſay, we have prayed for many of all ſorts, and ſo that we have done what is required (there being as we think ſome of all ſorts of the Church) and ſo we ſhould elude the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles exhortation by our own Tradition, as the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Elders uſed to do with Gods Commandements: the Apoſtle ſpeaking here of all men, as a diſtinct party from (yea all the reſidue above and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond) the Church of God, who are to pray for them. And that his
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:117749:129"/>former gloſs is untrue alſo, of all ſorts of men living under the inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged diſpenſation of grace is here evident, for we are not onely to pray for all thoſe that live under the Goſpel, but for all not under it alſo, that it might be extended to them; ſeeing he would have all men imbrace that, and be ſaved by him. But by Mr. <hi>Owens</hi> Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we need not pray for inlarging the Goſpel to thoſe <hi>Indians,</hi> or any further then it is, but onely pray for ſuch as have it preached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and not for all of them neither, but for ſome of them, which when its left to our judgments and wills to regulate us in, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles precept will ſcarce amount to this, Pray for whom ye liſt, or will.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <q>2. <hi>He ſays</hi> Paul <hi>leads us plainly to this Interpretation, for having wiſhed us to pray for all men, he expreſly intimates, that by all men, he underſtands men of all ſorts, ranks, conditions,</hi> &amp;c.</q> To this I ſay, That his intimating that we ſhould pray for all ſorts and ranks, doth not prove that he limits it to but ſome of all ſorts and ranks, which is the thing to be proved. Nay, The words of the Apoſtle confutes ſuch a limitation rather, for he ſays not, for ſome Kings, ſome people, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but for Kings indefinitely, and all in Authority uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally: ſo that he mentioning but one ſort of men, as eſpecially to be prayed for amongſt all men (becauſe they are ſuch as all the reſt are chiefly concerned in) and bidding us pray for all them, that is, all in Authority, and place of Government, he rather ſhews us by that inſtance of all of one ſort, what he would have us do in all the reſt, then any way teaches us to limit it but to ſome of all. For that thoſe words contain a formal diſtribution of All into many ſorts, I deny. But onely there he particularizeth one ſort, in praying for whom, all the reſt under them are in a manner included, ſo that his paralleling it with <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.31. where after the people are mentioned, Kings, Queens, Eunuches, Princes, Carpenters, Smiths, is both vain and impertinent. For beſides that there is no ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution here, except he include Carpenters and Smiths, under that phraſe, <hi>All in Authority,</hi> it would not (did he) ſerve his purpoſe, it not proving a limitation of the former General to but ſome of all ſorts; As if <hi>Jeremy</hi> had ſaid, Some of the Kings and Queens and Princes onely were carried away.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He ſays <q>
                        <hi>We are to pray for all whom God would have to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, But we ought not to pray for all and every one, knowing that ſome are Reprobates, and ſin to death, concerning whom we have an expreſs Caution not to pray for them.</hi>
                     </q> To this I anſwer, Firſt, That
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:117749:130"/>the words are not, Pray for All that God would have ſaved, but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, Pray for All—for God would have all ſaved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, We are to pray for all, or any whoſoever by this Precept; only the other tells us how long, till we ſee they have ſinned to death. That doth but exclude a certain condition or ſin of ſome, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude their perſons in all conditions. Nor are we to judge any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates by an eternal purpoſe, and ſo exclude them. God no where calls any ſo, but ſuch as have actually rejected (and are given over of) him. As he doth good, and affords patience and mercy till then to leade them to repentance,
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.16.</note> ſo, till then we are not to reject them. Thirdly, Nor are the words, Thou ſhalt not pray for him, but There is a ſin to death; I ſay not, that thou ſhouldſt pray for, or concerning it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He ſays, <q>
                        <hi>All ſhall be ſaved whom God will have to be ſaved, for who hath reſiſted his will?</hi>
                     </q> Anſwer, That all ſhall be ſaved that God would have to be ſaved, I deny, For God would have all men ſaved,
<note place="margin">Iſai. 49.4, 5.</note> but all men ſhall not be ſaved. He would often have gathered <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (for that often plainly refers to his coming in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets by his Spirit, and in his many great works done for them, for often he came not in the fleſh to them) and yet they were not ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered. He hath pleaſure or will (as the word <gap reason="foreign">

Thou wilt ſay to me, why doth he yet complain, for who hath reſiſted his Will? Therefore it may ſuffice to anſwer, as the Apoſtle doth, Nay but, O man, who art thou that anſwereſt againſt God? that art bold to contradict Gods Word with thy reaſon? Who art thou? thou canſt not ſee wood for trees, as we uſe to ſay, thou art in thy reaſon reſiſting him, and yet thou ſaieſt Who hath done it?

They may <hi>Stare contra conſilium Dei,</hi> they cannot <hi>evertere conſilium Dei.</hi> Had the Apoſtle ſaid, He will ſave all men, Mr. <hi>Owens</hi> reaſon had been weighty, but as it is ſaid, it is not.

                     </q> But 1. If Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> means of coming to it by outward hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we deny it, He would have Infants ſaved too, that he wills not to liſten to the truth. 2. If otherwiſe, we deny his <hi>Minor, That God would have not All in all Ages come to the knowledg of the truth.</hi> His confirmations of it are not concludent, <hi>viz.

That ſays not, he would not have all in thoſe ages come to know the truth. If his not dealing ſo with them, as with <hi>Jacob,</hi> argue it, then he would not have <hi>Job</hi> and his friends, or any of other Nations come to know it, for he dealt not ſo with any of them as with <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Though he revealed his Statutes and Judgments in that manner and meaſure to the <hi>Jews</hi> onely as to no Nation elſe, yet he would have had the Nations about them at the hearing of his name by them have come to them for it. And beſides, the Apoſtle ſaith not, and come to know his Statutes and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but to know Truth. And truth they had, ask the ſame Apoſtle elſe. He tells us ſo in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.11. <hi>They impriſoned the Truth in unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi> Sure they had it then, though they had it not ſo much, nor were ſo dealt with as <hi>Iſrael</hi> was. And he would not have had them impriſon it in unrighteouſneſs, and bound it by their underſtandings and exaltations of their own reaſons as they did, but retain and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg it, and ſubmit to glorifie God in it and be thankful. So might they have had the truth come more in upon them, and revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led much more unto them. Nor matters it that God ſuffered them to walk in their own wayes, and winked at thoſe times of ignorance, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.15. and 17.30. for that ſhews but his patience, partly in not conſuming them for their follies, and partly his Juſtice in giving them over to their own deluſions: but not that they had not truth, or that he would not have had them own and acknowledg it, and ſeek after him in it; nay, both thoſe places intimate the contrary. The firſt ſaith, he left not himſelf without witneſs, in that he did them good, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The other, that even ſome of their own Poets had, and held forth ſuch glimpſes of truth, as had they minded and ſubmitted to them, they would not have worſhipped Idols and Images of their
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:117749:131"/>own framing, but groped after him that made themſelves. Nor doth the hiding of his myſtery from former Ages confirm it (<hi>Col.</hi> 1.26.) for that was the uniting of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> in ſuch glorious privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges in Chriſt, which is the myſtery there ſpoken of, which was hidden too from the <hi>Jews,</hi> Yea, from the Apoſtles too in former Ages; and yet they had Truth, though not all Truth. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.25, 26. was before ſpoken to. But 3. Beſides all this, we may ſay, that he ſpeaks not here of the Ages paſt, nor in the time paſt. Its not <gap reason="foreign">

Over and above what they had formerly, God now ſends his Goſpel unto all Nations, and would have them come to know it, embrace it, and propagate, and preſerve it to all their individuals and poſterities. This he would have them do, and this is approveable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and acceptable to him, and ſo God wills all to be ſaved. He would have had them acknowledge Truth in times paſt, but now he would have them much more come to it, and acknowledge it, it being more fully opened. So that our Aſſertion and Expoſition will bear up it ſelf againſt his Arguments. We may uſe the Apoſtles <hi>All men</hi> without limiting or reſtraining it, (which is all I deſire) and defend our ſelves againſt the loud clamor of Error, and Hereſie, which the ſpirit of Error faſtens upon us by thoſe that have exalted their reaſon above the Scripture, and carry themſelves as Maſters to it, not ſcholars of the Spirit of God in it: not onely the words themſelves but the ſcope of the place too will bear us out, but it will not them that limit it to the Believers, and to the Elect, for (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide that they never are called all men) we finde both precept and practice for praying for ſuch men as are not ſo, but prove repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate; and we finde God by his Spirit conteſting with many to ſeek him, and to look after, and receive the knowledg of the Truth, and be ſaved by him, which yet for rejecting thoſe his wraſtlings, have been rejected, as is plain to any that minde, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.9, 10, 11, 14. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.22, 23, 24. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.37. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.41. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <hi>To avoid the light of which, he corrupts the Text by adding to the words, but detracting from the ſenſe; he will have it read, that he is patient toward us, not willing that any of us ſhould periſh, but all of us ſhould come to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi>
                     </q> By ſuch liberty he might anſwer any Argument, For he doth like the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> when we tell them of being juſtified by Faith, and not by Works, they can anſwer with this addition, the Works of the Law; we are not juſtified by them, but by other works we are. Beſides, who are that Us none of which he would have periſh, and all of whom he would have come to Repentance? He ſays, <q>

Could any of them periſh, ſhould Chriſt come the ſooner, who can in no wiſe be deceived or drawn away by perverſe Doctrines from Chriſt? Or are thoſe that have received the precious promiſes of eternal ſalvation, and Brethren to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, in danger to periſh, if Chriſt ſhould come ſooner, who are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to think long for his coming for their deliverance? Or are they yet ſhort of Repentance? <hi>Apage has nugas.</hi> The plain ſenſe is, That God is patient in behalf of us that believe, and doth not ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily execute Judgment for us, (as the like phraſe alſo ſignifies in <hi>Luke</hi> 18.7, 8.) though he be much provoked to come and plead our cauſe, and deſtroy ungodly men; yet he forbears, not willing any ſhould periſh, not being haſty to deſtroy any, as one that would have them periſh, or as one that delighteth in their deſtruction; but
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:117749:132"/>affording all men in general ſpace for repentance of their follies, and evils, deſires and approves of it, that they repent, his goodneſs and forbearance leading to that, even ſuch as abuſe it, and treaſure up wrath againſt themſelves by it, as is affirmed of <hi>Jezabel, Rev.</hi> 2.21. and others, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4, 5. Now, as we deſire not to ſtretch the latter clauſe to every individual, (as to Infants while not capable of it) ſo neither can it be limited to the Elect only: he willing others alſo (as that fore-quoted Scripture proves) to come to Repentance; but to the generality of men we do extend it. That God hated any from eternity, he hath often ſaid, but never yet proved it, nor hath he ſhewed, that God denies repentance to any, before they put away obſtinately what would lead them to it. He that gives that which leads to Repentance, cannot be ſaid to deny it to them to whom he gives that, while that is giving to them: as he that gives a plaiſter that will heal, if men according to the power they have would apply it, cannot be ſaid to deny healing, though ſome refuſing to apply the plaiſter are never healed.</p>

"<hi>That to taſt ſignifies, ſo to drink up a thing, that no one drop remains for any to drink after one,</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſaith) is an expoſition of the word <hi>Taſt,</hi> contrary to its uſual ſignification; for men are ſaid to taſt when they do but ſip or make tryal, or the ſweetneſs or bitterneſs, &amp;c. of a thing; not when they eat or drink it all up.

We ſee him who for that end that he might ſuffer Death for all, or for every one of the reſt of men (of whom he had been ſpeaking) by Death attained to this, to have glory and honor, though not as yet to have all things put under him. The one part of that prophecy is fulfilled though the other be not. The next verſe of bringing many ſons to glory, is not ſpoken of, as of his work, but as Gods. He made Chriſt perfect through ſufferings, that he ſhould be their cheif Leader or Captaine in the way to Salvation, in which he ſpeaks of Chriſt under another Notion then in this Verſe. For there are two conſiderations here of the Death and ſufferings of Chriſt: one as he is the propitiation and gave himſelfe a ranſome ſuffering in ſtead of Sinners, and thats in the 9. verſe, for every man. 2. As having the promiſe of a ſeed, or as God having a purpoſe to make ſome ſons in him by Faith, to which he muſt firſt be viewed as a propitiation for man, that he might
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:117749:134"/>be an Object of their Faith, and a <hi>medium</hi> of their ſonſhip) he was to be their patterne and Leader, their Captaine and Example in the way, to whom he would conforme them, and whom they might have as an example for direction and incouragement in their believing, and this end of his ſufferings reſpecteth onely thoſe that being brought in to believe on him, ſhould need his example to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and guide them in ſuch trials and ſufferings, eſpecially for God, as thereby they are expoſed to. So he ſpeaks of his dying and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, <hi>ver.</hi> 10.14.18. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.17, 18. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21. <hi>Chriſt ſuffered for you, leaving you an example that ye ſhould follow his ſteps.</hi> So alſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2, 3, 4. Now <hi>M. Owen</hi> confounds theſe two together into one, and makes his ſufferings as a Captaine and Leader in the way to life, to be but of equall latitude with his ſuffering by way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation: And ſo he would cut off all propitiation from the old Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Believers, who had him not as their example to look at in their ſufferings: and 2. from all Infants that cannot have him as their example to walke by, and 3. from all, till believes and in the way of Salvation, for neither of converſion or any ſuch thing as is of that nature was he an example, he never being out of Gods way. And this indeed is the very iſſue of that argument againſt the latitude of that Scripture, in its ſignification according to its expreſſion.</p>
                  <p n="4">4.

Where there is no Law, ſure there is no tranſgreſſion, if there was no obligation upon them to live to him, then it was no chargeable fault upon them that they did not ſo live, but ſure all the world ſhall one day ſee that they had ſomething of his Law, though they heard not of his Death.

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:117749:135"/>mention of thoſe words in the Chapter, much leſs amongſt thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding verſes, of which this is rendred as the reaſon; but let us view his arguments for it, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <q>
                        <hi>That here the Reſurrection of Chriſt is conjoyned with his Death. He died for them and Roſe againe; but for whomſoever Chriſt riſeth, he roſe for their juſtification, Ro.</hi> 4. <hi>ult. and they muſt be juſtified, But All are not ſo. Anſ.</hi>
                     </q> 1. That his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection is conjoyned is true, and ſo it is intimately in all the other places of 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2, 9. and where ever his Death for us is mentioned, its intimately the Death of him that roſe againe; for had he not riſen he could not have been a ranſome or propitiation; its not ſaid here he roſe again for them, but ſimply, <hi>He roſe againe;</hi> which indeed he muſt needs be conceived to have done as an Object to be lived to; we cannot live to a dead man. 2 That for whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he riſeth, he riſeth for their juſtification, and they muſt be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; the places of <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>ult.</hi> &amp; 8.34. ſay not, they being believers onely that there ſpeak applicatively of themſelves. He dyed for our ſins, this he did as and while we were ungodly; and he roſe againe for our juſtification, that we believers (as in <hi>ver.</hi> 24. To whom it ſhall be imputed, we believing in him that raiſed up <hi>Jeſus,</hi> he raiſed him with this intention that we believers) might be juſtified. The coupling of two ſuch ſpeeches together do not argue that the objects of the acts mentioned in them are of equall latitude, as in <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.14. He that raiſed up the Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> will alſo raiſe us up by <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and preſent us with you. Its not a good Inference, becauſe they two are put together, therefore all that are raiſed by <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſhall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented with the believers. And yet 3. If by Juſtification we mean a right and juſt giving Sentence of freedom from that Death that was come upon us in <hi>Adam</hi> as the reward of his diſobedience, ſo I grant it in its latitude, according to <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. to All men to juſtification of life, or if it be meant juſtification in the publick perſon, as that that is open for all to partake of, upon obedience of Faith, and ſo for our juſtification, be onely that we might be juſtified in his perſon, and that he being perfected might be fitted to juſtifie All or any man upon his believing, ſo I grant it too, and affirme that he is able and fit to juſtifie All upon their looking by Faith unto him. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if it ſignifie, that we undoubtedly might have that juſtification, and be preſented righteous and acceptable before him, then the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall extent of all ſo juſtified, and all he dyed for, is denyed, and not at all proved from thoſe places as is ſaid before: Juſtification ſo
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:117749:135"/>not being an immediate fruit or effect of Chriſts reſurection, but following upon Faith as is plaine, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5, 6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. whence its ſaid <hi>to be by Faith, by the name of the Lord by the Spirit of God &amp;c.</hi> But inaſmuch as he could neither be an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Faith to any, nor any be diſcharged from their ſins, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented righteous in him, had Death ſwallowed him up, and he never riſen, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.14, 15, 16, 17.) therefore he is ſaid <hi>to riſe for our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification,</hi> that he might juſtifie us in believing on him, and ſo us that beleeve on him. That juſtification in the moſt ſpeciall ſenſe doth come upon many that Chriſt dyed for, is granted, and ſo both meet in many the ſame perſons, and ſuch may ſay they are the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of both; but that thence they have equall Objects in point of number, is denyed. Thoſe <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that intred into <hi>Canaan,</hi> might truly ſay, the Lord judged <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> to bring us out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and he led us in the wilderneſſe to poſſeſſe of <hi>Canaan;</hi> and yet all that came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> or were led in the wilderneſſe, were not poſſeſſed of <hi>Canaan.</hi>

All that Chriſt raiſes out of Death, he died for, that they might be ſo raiſed. Elſe how comes it by man, if not by ſomething acted in the humane Nature, and not onely by the divine Power of God? But Chriſt ſhall make all alive. But Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> tells us, <q>
                        <hi>This All, is but All believers, becauſe he brings Arguments from Faith, the Goſpel, and ſuch things to prove it, and ſpeaks after of Chriſts members, them of whom he is the firſt fruits.</hi>
                     </q> As if the Apoſtle might not ſpeak of the Reſurrection of all men, and yet ſpeaking to believers bring proofs fitted to them. And as if his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-mentioning of ſuch as believe, proves that he aſſerted not the Reſurrection of any but them. Its plain, ſome of the <hi>Corinths</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the Reſurrection of the Dead, not onely that they themſelves ſhould ariſe, but alſo the dead in general, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. Now what they denied he aſſerted. VVhich its clear alſo, is a Truth not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſtrated by reaſon, but meerly to be believed upon divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the foundation of it laid in Chriſts Reſurrection. And therefore, whereas Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> (and <hi>Beza</hi> too) object this, <q>
                        <hi>That the Apoſtles Arguments are taken from the Reſurrection of Chriſt, the hope, faith, cuſtomes, and expected reward of Chriſtians, which would have been ridiculous to be held out to the men of the world to prove

                     </q> Its very abſurd. For 1. The Apoſtle never held out other Arguments to the <hi>Heathen</hi> then Chriſts Reſurrection, which he preached as a matter of faith to them, and declared as a matter evidently known to themſelves, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.30, 31. 2. They being believers that denied the Reſurrection of the dead in general, he might well ſhew the inconſiſtency of that denial with their own principles, and how it overthrew the moſt of thoſe things which they made profeſſion of as Chriſtians. For the dead in general not ariſing, then neither ſhould they ariſe and receive the reward of their faith and ſufferings. His arguments of that nature ſhew but that they were Chriſtians he writ to, capable of ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations, not that he aſſerted only the Reſurrection of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.

As the Father raiſeth the dead, and quickneth them, and is not the Sons quickning whom he will, both applied after to his quickning here, and raiſing all hereafter? Doth that hinder the truth of his quickning whom he will, that he will quicken <hi>All?</hi> So, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.13.

Nor doth his making peculiar applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the uſefulneſs of this Doctrine to believers, hinder his affirming the Reſurrection in general; For thats an uſual thing to make ſpecial application of any general doctrine to thoſe to whom he treats of it, as from Gods bounty to all, to preſs believers in caſe of want of wiſdom to ask of God, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1 5, 6. and ſo from the doctrine of the general Judgment aſſerted, to infer the account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving of believers, and to draw uſeful deductions to them in ſpecial, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.11, 12, 13. So his arguing here alſo is unſatisfactory.</p>

                        <hi>That by the words,</hi> All men, <hi>can none be underſtood but thoſe upon whom the free gift actually comes to the juſtification of life meaning to eternal life.</hi>

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:117749:138"/>men: and the others obedience and righteouſneſs, brought juſtification and ſalvation upon all them that he ſtood in the room of as a publick perſon; thats the ſum of his diſcourſe upon it:</hi>
                     </q> which (though if by juſtification and ſalvation, he means but an acquitting them from that charge or judgement that ſhould have forthwith deſtroyed All in <hi>Adam</hi> upon his ſin, and ſo a giving them an eſcape from that, or a juſtifying and putting ſalvation into Chriſt as the publick perſon; for all it may be granted, yet it) both changes the Apoſtles phraſe as before was noted, reading (upon) for (to) and leaves it unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, whoſe room he ſtood in, and if he ſpeak of juſtification from all ſins paſt and preſent, with acceptation into favour, and communication of eternall life; is to be denyed, and I deſire his proof for, it.

                        <hi>that it ſeems a monſtrous doctrine that Chriſt ſhould ſtand in the room of reprobate perſons, hated of him from eternity, ſuch as he knew not, hid the myſteries of ſalvation from, and refuſed to pray for, who were damned already in Hell, and irrecoverably paſt the limits of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</hi>

But men were reprobated and damned for rejecting the beams of light and truth that came from him who firſt virtually, and after actually bare that blow, that ſhould at the firſt otherwiſe have deſtroyed them, and All men. He might as well have ſaid, that its a horrible thing to conceive as the Apoſtle intimates, <hi>that its poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible any ſhould be deſtroyed for whom Chriſt died, and bring upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſwift deſtruction, whom he bought &amp;c.</hi> as is intimated, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.11. &amp; 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1.

And as for his anſwers to thoſe deviſed Arguments, I ſhall not ſpend time and paper about them. Onely whereas he ſaith <q>
                        <hi>that</hi> Chriſt <hi>is no where compared to</hi> Adam <hi>in reſpect of the extent of the Object of his Death, but only of the eſſicacie of his obedience:</hi>
                     </q> That that is falſe, the Scriptures in hand evidently ſheweth, for he ſaith not onely, <hi>As by one offence judgement came untocondemnation, ſo by one righteouſneſs to juſtification of life:</hi> but expreſly maketh the compariſon too in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their objects; As by one offence to all men to condemnation, ſo by one righteouſneſſe to All men to juſtification of life.

The wages and puniſhment of this ſin, that is, deſtruction and utter ruine.
<note place="margin">Ioh. 8.31, 32.</note> The latter of theſe Chriſt bare for us, not the former; for then he ſhould have had our pollution in him too, which is croſſe to truth. Therefore when we ſpeak of bringing us from the death we fell into in <hi>Adam,</hi> we are to be underſtood,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:117749:139"/>of that Chriſt endured for us, not the other, which he brings us out of by his Word and Spirit received into us, and not by his dying onely, or Reſurrection alſo. And therefore <hi>M. Owen</hi> here prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, as in another paſſage faſtned upon <hi>M. More,</hi> he abuſes him, for he no where tells us (as <hi>M. Owen</hi> charges him) that the preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf juſt before the Father, was the ultimate thing by Chriſt intended, not a tittle that way.</p>
                  <p>He hath alſo many heavie words againſt <hi>M. More,</hi> for ſaying, God accepted the Sacrifice of Chriſt as if all had dyed, riſen, ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed, ſatisfied, &amp;c. which ſpring from his owne miſtake, as if Chriſt in dying for All, was ſaid to dye and ſatisfie for all ſins that ever they ſhould or might commit, and ſo procure an acquittance and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge from them All to be without faile as on his part, and what ever failing in any condition happen on their part made over unto all; which as its contrary to thoſe intimations that ſpeak of their periſhing, for whom Chriſt dyed, as a thing poſſible; yea, and of ſome ments pulling ſwift condemnation upon themſelves, whom he bought, which could not be were that poſition true; ſo its alſo a gap to all careleſneſs and licentiouſneſs, for then let all men take what courſe they will, Either Chriſt dyed for them or not: if not, no endeavour can do them good, God is their enemy and hated them before they offended him, even from all eternity, and they muſt have no better, do what they can, then what the hatred of an Omnipotent God will produce unto them: if he did<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Then <hi>eia agite,</hi> nothing can pull a dram of wrath upon them, their ſcore are all wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped off, both what they have run into and what they ſhall. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle never preached ſuch Doctrine, but that they that walk in the light, as he is in it, that walk not after the Fleſh but after the Spirit, that are rooted in the Faith, and not moved from the hope of the Goſpell, ſhall have this benefit by Chriſts death, that no condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſhall befall them, all their ſins are cleanſed &amp;c. Verily, Chriſt putting himſelf into the place of <hi>Adam</hi> in the day that he ſinned, and in due time bearing that heavie death that elſe had ſeiſed on All and overcoming it, and preſenting himſelf to God as a Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror over it, was far more acceptable to God, then if all men in the world had dyed and overcome. For we had done it but for our ſelves, and out of love to our ſelves; but he out of obedience to his Father and love to us, and the ſame worke is far more acceptable to God, when done out of Charity, then when done out of ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love

                  <p>"<hi>Heobjects further againſt</hi> T.

Surely Dr. <hi>Preſton</hi> in his <hi>Treatiſe of Faith,</hi> about <hi>pag.</hi> 8. asking whom Gods Righteouſneſs is giving to, and anſwering, to All without exception, thought it not an Impoſture, but called it the ground of all comfort or conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: nor made he ſuch a concluſion, <hi>Ergo,</hi> it comes upon All, and ſo All ſhall be ſaved, <hi>Solvite mortales curas,</hi> &amp;c. But I ſhall now paſs to his Inference. And firſt I note, That Mr. <hi>Owon</hi> deales fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently with <hi>T. Moore</hi> in relating him: for whereas by way of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and to prevent miſtake, he ſays, That this recovery is in Chriſt, ſo as that in him, and by him in that done, and wrought in his own body, they are again redeemed, reſtored, and made righteous, and that it might be ſaid as things are looked upon in Chriſt, who was in the room of All, that (as all in the former reſpect have ſinned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo) all are juſtified freely by his grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This clauſe <hi>[In him, and as things are looked upon in Chriſt]</hi> which was the principal diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing clauſe in this parallel, he wholy omits and fals upon the reſt, as if he had ſaid, They are in themſelves juſtified, redeemed, reſtored, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then upon this man of Clouts he falls very fouly, as if he beat all to pieces Maſter <hi>Moores</hi> compariſon in it. The leaving out that Clauſe, which was the moſt ſpecial thing in it, made way for all the following abſurdities that Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> puts upon him, and the keeping that in, would Anſwer them all. For
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:117749:141"/>a man may be all this in another, and yet not the better for it in the iſſue. For I ask, Were not we once all righteous, holy, innocent, in the image of God in <hi>Adam?</hi> Did not God make us ſo there? And what now ſhall we infer, holy and righteous, and yet condemned, dye, accurſed? will God caſt his own Image into hell? And ſhall we produce the Scriptures, that the righteous ſhall ſhine as ſtars in the Firmament, but all were made righteous in <hi>Adam, Ergo, All ſhall ſhine as ſtars in the Firmament:</hi> but this is untrue, and contrary to Scripture, Many ſhall periſh, <hi>Ergo,</hi> All were not righteous in <hi>Adam.</hi> Who would not hiſs out ſuch reaſonings? Again All were ſinners, and condemned to death in <hi>Adam,</hi> yet <hi>Enoch</hi> never died, and <hi>Elias</hi> was taken up into heaven, and many ſhall be glorious with Chriſt. Like this, The <hi>Kingdom</hi> is all at peace, and agreed with the <hi>King</hi> in its body Repreſentative the <hi>Parliament,</hi> therefore none in the <hi>Kingdom</hi> oppoſeth him, nor ſhall any ever be condemned by him, ſuppoſe he come to power for doing any thing againſt him. <hi>Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum admiſſi riſum teneamus?</hi> Chriſt the repreſentative perſon was juſtified, and ſo all juſtified and reſtored in him, Therefore all men in their own perſons ſhall be eternally ſaved.

Theſe things being the off-ſpring of Mr. <hi>Owens</hi> fraudulency, how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently is that Scripture quoted by him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. that ſpeaks of juſtification as coming upon men by receit of Chriſt, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </q> A thing that we affirm not, as he expreſſes it, <hi>viz.</hi> We ſay not that he ſuſtained the perſon of any, either as Elect or Reprobate, in giving himſelf a ranſom from the death come upon all for their ſin in <hi>Adam,</hi> but of men as faln, not as Reprobated for rejecting his Truth, nor as elected through obedience of the Truth: and therefore his firſt Argument being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his ſuſtaining the perſons of men under the notion of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, and the ſeed of the Serpent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> needs no further anſwering. Otherwiſe we ſay, that for them that by denying the Lord that bought them come to be rejected, and to be of the feed of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, Chriſt ſuſtained the place of a publike perſon, as onely faln and condemned in <hi>Adam,</hi> his other arguments follow, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <q>2. <hi>Chriſt as a publike perſon repreſented only them, for whoſe ſakes be ſet himſelf apart for that office and imployment wherein he was ſuch a repreſentative; but upon his own teſtimony which we have,</hi> Joh. 17.19. <hi>he ſet himſelf apart to that ſervice and imployment for the ſakes onely of ſome, and not for all and every one, Therefore he was not a publike perſon in the room of All.</hi>
                     </q> To which I anſwer, 1. By denying the <hi>Minor,</hi> for neither doth Chriſt ſay for their ſakes only I ſanctifie my ſelf, nor were they there ſpoken of, all the believers; ſo that had he limited it to thoſe only, he had by this argument repreſented one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly them that were ſent into the world, as he was ſent, to preach the Goſpel (for to them that ſpeech is there applied) and ſo excluded all that ſhould believe through their words: Read <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.18, 19, 20. 2. Nor doth he tells us that that that he ſanctified himſelf to there, was all that in which he was a publike perſon and repreſentative in giving himſelf a ranſom, and if that be not proved, he ſays nothing.</p>

                     <q>3. <hi>Chriſt as a ſurety was a publike perſon, but all are not in that Covenant of which he was a ſurety, Therefore not a publike perſon for All.</hi>
                     </q> This Argument, is fallacious, leaning upon this foundation, If Chriſt was not a publike perſon for all in every reſpect, Then for all in none, which we deny. His being a ſurety relates to his underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in heaven to ſee the Covenant which he hath already ſealed performed to the parties to whom it appertaineth. Its like this, The Parliament as a publike body have ingaged their publike faith for ſeeing all them paid that have lent them any thing, but all the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:117749:142"/>Commons in the Kingdom have not lent to them, and ſo they are not ingaged to all of them in that way: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are not the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative of all the Commons in the Kingdom. The buſineſs of Chriſts Suretiſhip he quite miſtakes, as if the Apoſtle there affirmed him to be a Surety for all for whom he died; which that place ſays not.</p>

                     <q>5. <hi>The fifth ſays, That Chriſt never did any thing in vain in reſpect of any for whom he was a publike perſon. But many things which he did as a publike perſon were altogether in vain and fruitleſs, in regard of the greateſt part of the ſons of men,</hi> &amp;c.</q> To which, If by fruitleſs he mean totally, both in reſpect of His, and his Fathers Glory, and their good, then the <hi>Major</hi> is confeſſed, and the <hi>Minor</hi> denied.

Then I deny the <hi>Major.</hi> For Chriſt as a Prophet and Teacher ſpeaks to many men in vain, in that reſpect, See <hi>Iſai.</hi> 49.4. <hi>And I ſaid, I laboured in vain,</hi> ſpeaking in the perſon of Chriſt, as the 5. and 6. verſes make it plain.

But while we comfort ſouls by minding them what God hath done for them in Chriſt, and what he is ready to do further; we are alſo to let them know, that its in his way, in attending to his word, looking to his ſon, abiding in him, &amp;c. that they ſhall meet with all the efficacy of Chriſts bloud to eternall ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; ſo it will cleanſe them from all their ſins, and preſent them righteous, and obtain the diſpenſation of Spirit to them to abide in them for ever.

But other wayes of comforting from it, we know none. And if to ſpeak
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:117749:143"/>of it as the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaks of it, be to vilifie and count it a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon thing, I know not wherein truly to magnifie it; we muſt ſtick to his ſpeaking, however any cenſure us for ſo doing. And yet we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the bloud of Chriſt truly precious, as being the bloud of God, the bloud of the Covenant, and as ſuch, not common to All, much leſſe prophane and of little vertue. We judge it of infinite eſteem with God, ſo that it obtains what ever according to the agreement between Chriſt and him it requireth; and being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, and the ſprinkling of it received, it ſpeaks peace, purges the conſcience, cleanſes from ſin, keeps off puniſhment; yea (abid in) it leads up the ſoul thats ſanctified by it to all perfection: yea, ſo ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous we judge it, and of ſuch value with God; that he moſt ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revenges mens ſlighting and contemning it, not believing on it, or not abiding in it; yea, to utter deſtruction, according to the intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of theſe Scriptures that we come to ſpeak to; That which he makes an Argument of our ſlighting it, that we make an Argument of our prizing it, and counting it precious in the ſight of God; even that he ſo ſeverely puniſhes and deſtroyes them, that having it ſhed for them &amp; propounded to them, would not truſt it, but rebelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him that ſhed it. I think it ſprings from the preciouſneſs &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Pſa. 2.10, 11. Ioh. 3 36.</note> both in himſelf, &amp; with God, that God ſo ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſhes thoſe that believe not on him, that refuſe to Kiſs him.

                     </gap>e enough from falling, no matter for abiding in Gods wayes, and taking heed to his Word; he may hear any Doctrine, do any thing, the vertue of Chriſts bloud will preſerve him from finall miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carrying, and to ſay it will not, is to diſhonour it. Truth will fling off many ſuch fooliſh flouriſhes as theſe, which yet I meet with, taken up, and uſed ſometimes with great confidence in Pulpits: but I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe I pity them that ſo do. The Word of the Lord is a reproach to them, and they cannot bear it: they will not give that honour to Chriſts bloud, that God gives it in the Scripture, but yet will plead for an honour of their own framing: like the old <hi>Phariſees</hi> that honoured the Sepulchers of the Prophets, and in the mean time believed not their witneſs, and killed their ſucceſſors. I ſhall ſhut up this point with <hi>M. Owens</hi> own words in his Preface. If we main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the vertue of Chriſts bloud, let us do it in his own language, or be for ever ſilent: that is preciouſneſſe in it, that God aſcribes to it, our inventions though never ſo ſplendid in our own eyes, are unto him an abomination.</p>
                  <p>The places oppugned by him in their native intimations and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications, are <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.11. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. which we do not bring to prove (as he ſuggeſts) that Chriſt dyed for All, and every man in the world; but to prove that he dyed for more then the Elect, and ſo uſe not ſo directly for the proof of the extent of it to its fulneſſe, as to diſprove their limitation of it to the Elect and Believers. Let us view what he ſayes to them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Firſt is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.15. <hi>Deſtroy not him with thy meat for whom Chriſt dyed.</hi> We ſay thence, that the Apoſtle intimates that one may periſh for whom Chriſt dyed, elſe his admonition was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether groundleſſe, as empty and ſuperfluous, as if he had bidden them, not to make Chriſts bloud by his Father to be abhorred, or not to pull the ſtars out of the Firmament, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>To this <hi>M. Owen (ut nodum quem ſolvere nequit, gladio diſſecet)
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:117749:144"/>denies that there is any ſuch intimation (he might as well have ſaid theſe words are not written) onely ſayes he, others are commanded not to do that that goeth in a direct way to deſtroy him;</hi>
                     </q> he ſhould have added, but which never ſo much done could never have ſo deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; and ſo they might have anſwered, Ah <hi>Paul,</hi> thou ſetteſt a ſcar-crow before us, we can never do that; we are ſure, between all our ſtumblings of him, and his deſtruction, that Chriſt hath dyed for, there is as great a gulf ſet, as between hell &amp; <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome. But he adds <q>
                        <hi>they might be dehorted from that thats in it ſelf impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible becauſe though the one could not periſh in reſpect of the event, yet the other might give occaſion of periſhing in a procuring cauſe.</hi>
                     </q> To which I anſwer. 1. That I never finde the Apoſtle giving ſuch dehortations. 2. I ask, is there any procuring cauſe of his periſhing for whom Chriſt dyed? Can any thing procure that the bloud of Chriſt ſhed for him, ſhall not ſave him? if not, why talks he here of a procuring cauſe of that that cannot be procured? if yes, then he grants what he fights againſt. The Apoſtle ſayes not, Do not that that might deſtroy thy brother had not Chriſt dyed for him; but, <q>
                        <hi>deſtroy not with thy meat him that Chriſt dyed for. From that ſleeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Anſwer, he falls to queſtion, if a man may not be dehorted from attempting that that he cannot poſſibly do?</hi>
                     </q> To which I ſay, yes; by ſhewing him that he goes about an impoſſibility, as <hi>Gamaliel</hi> did, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.38, 39. but there is no ſuch way of dehorting here; no, nor doth he dehort from attempting it onely, but from doing it. He ſayes not, Attempt not to deſtroy him, you will loſe your labour in it (nor doth he intimate that they had ſo wicked an aime in what they did, as to ſeek to deſtroy him) but, <hi>Deſtroy not him for whom Chriſt dyed,</hi> do not that which may have ſuch an iſſue upon him. I would have him furniſh me with one Inſtance, in which God bids a man not to do that, that according to his own declaration he hath told him cannot poſſibly be done: ſo he had done more, then by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the queſtion. His inſtance of the Souldiers not breaking the bones of Chriſt, is nothing, except he could ſhew, that though it was revealed to them that they could not poſſibly do it, yet God bid them not to do it. He asks further, <q>
                        <hi>If every one be damned that one attempts to deſtroy by grieving him with unocharitable walking?</hi>
                     </q> I anſwer, thats not materiall, its enough that every one (though Chriſt dyed for him) is deſtroyed, who by reaſon of anothers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable walking is turned aſide from Chriſt, ſo as that he never
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:117749:144"/>more walks with him and owns him. After all this, he cals ſuch Arguments as this <hi>Men of Straw;</hi> but ſuch as he cannot beat down with any fair dealing. Thats his policy to amuſe the Reader, and ſcare him from it, by caſting diſgrace on it, when he cannot evert it. Laſtly he tels us, <q>
                        <hi>That he denies not but many periſh utterly, whom we in our walking are bound to account ſo redeemed.</hi>
                     </q> I might put him to it to prove it that we are bound to judge ſuch, or ſuch a man elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or redeemed, that is not. But ſuppoſe it true; yet this ſerves not his purpoſe, for the Apoſtle ſpeaks in the generall Theory, not with ſpeciall application to this or that; joyns in a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept deſtroying, and him that Chriſt dyed for; though we may judge this or that man Elect that is not; yet ſhould we ſay in the generall, bring not an Elect man by deceit to deſtruction, <hi>M. O.</hi> would go neer to tell us there is a repugnancy <hi>in terminis,</hi> that in that we ſay a man is Elect, we intimate, its impoſſible for him to be ſo deceived. We do not ſay, Deſtroy not Chriſt, becauſe we know that none can; If that was but the Apoſtles meaning, it was better to have ſaid, Indeavour not to deſtroy him, for whom, for any thing thou knoweſt, Chriſt dyed. But Deſtroy not him for whom Chriſt dyed, contains an implication <hi>in terminis,</hi> if it be declared too that none ſuch can be deſtroyed. So that in all this he hath but trifled.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond place is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.11. <q>
                        <hi>Shall thy weak brother periſh for whom Chriſt dyed?</hi>
                     </q> which (he ſaith) hath a little more ſtrength then the other. Therefore we muſt look for a little more weakneſs in his Anſwer to it, in which he flies about, and knows not where to faſten. Firſt, by Periſhing <q>

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:117749:145"/>we thence infer not, no more then we can from that, <hi>No fornicator or Adulterer ſhall inherit Gods Kingdom;</hi> but that he ſo avenges it in all, that by occaſion of offences perſiſt to ſtumble at Chriſt, we fear not to infer. Surely his after words are no reaſon of his not underſtanding by periſhing, eternal damnation, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                     <q>

                     </q> Sure he thinks hypocrites, and ſuch as Chriſt died not for, may ſo periſh. But he gives that, I ſuppoſe, for a ſecond Anſwer, and ſo he mightily changes the caſe, and turns the Apoſtles words into another form, for now in ſtead of, And ſhal thy weak brother periſh for whom Chriſt died? he hath made it, And ſhall they counterfeit brother pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh for whom Chriſt did but ſeem to dye? Nay, he tells us, <q>
                        <hi>As he is ſaid to be a brother, ſo Chriſt is ſaid to dye for him;</hi>
                     </q> That is, he counterfeited, and made the Church believe he was a brother, and Chriſt counterfeited too with him, and made him, (nay the Church too) believe that he died for him. Do not theſe things quite ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate all the force of the Apoſtles Arguments and Aggravations, which are three eſpecially, <q>1. <hi>He is thy brother, and therefore thou oughteſt to care for him.</hi> 2. <hi>Thy weak brother, and therefore to be the more tendered by thee.</hi> 3. <hi>Chriſt died for him, and wilt thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him?</hi>
                     </q> Had they been of Mr. <hi>Owens</hi> minde, they might eaſily have retorted it thus; If he be a brother indeed, and Chriſt indeed have died for him, he will continue with us, and cannot periſh, for Chriſt hath procured all good things for him, and ſo preſervation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if he do fall, we have but diſcovered a hypocrite, and parted with him, and diſcern that Chriſt never died for him. Is this to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the Scripture, or to pervert and elude it? But why did he but ſeem to be a brother? Surely hypocrites uſe-rather to boaſt themſelves of ſtrength, and ſeem to be ſtrong, then to appear weak; they uſe not to diſſimble and counterfeit the loweſt places, or leaſt ſtrength, as we may ſee in <hi>Jehu.</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>But we are brethren onely by Faith.</hi>
                     </q> Thats untrue. In a Church-Fellowſhip, Faith and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion make brethren, with profeſſed agreement in joynt worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And ſuch alſo as have true illuminations, and ſome meaſure of ſaith in believing the truth, and ſeeking God therein, may, and do turn aſide as the Scriptures witneſs. As the <hi>Galathians</hi> did run well (not hypocritically, but well) and yet ſome of them <hi>Paul</hi> greatly ſcared, for they were turned away from him that called them. And others put away a good conſcience, making ſhipwrack of faith,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:117749:145"/>1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.20. Sure a counterfeit profeſſion never makes a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Weak believers not yet ſetled and rooted, nor ſo far prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with, as to be brought to commit their ſouls to Chriſt, nor made one with Chriſt, and his choſen ones in ſpirit &amp; throughneſs of heart, are in danger of falling off by corrupt doctrines and temptations, if they take not diligent heed to Chriſt and his doctrine. Thence the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles were eſpecially earneſt in watching over, &amp; admoniſhing ſuch. And yet that faith, truth, confeſſion, goodneſs of way and walking they had, might truly denominate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> brethren. And ſuch the Apoſtle ſpeaks of here as had had ſome illuminations, and their hearts cloſing with the truth, yea, the truth ſo powerful in them as to pull them out of the worlds way and fellowſhips, and made them attend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Church for further knowledg, and divine teachings; yet being not eſtabliſhed, and ſo throughly united to them in Spirit, they might be ſhaken and turned away again by offenſive carriages. But that the Apoſtle ſhould mean him thou counteſt a brother, and Chriſt to have died for, or wiſh him onely to avoid endeavouring his periſhing, is a meer perverting of the Apoſtles ſaying: The Apoſtle uſes not to ſpeak things contrary to truth, to ſuit with ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appearances to men, as we noted above. As for his making us draw an univerſal Concluſion from this or the other Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> That therefore he died for all Reprobates, its none of ours, but this; Therefore the after periſhing of men proves not that Chriſt died not for them, as they uſe to argue; nor did he dye for the Elect onely, as they ſay.</p>

                     </q> Thats not ſo, for in ver. 20. where he ſpeaks again to this Apoſtacy of theirs, they are ſaid to have eſcaped the pollutions of the world, through the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.

Doth he buy any into his Church, but by the Death and bloodſhed of Jeſus Chriſt. He ſays, Yes, and thats the ſecond thing to be ſpoken to, in which he ſays <q>2. <hi>its uncertain whether this buying was made with the ranſom of his blood, or by the goodneſs of God delivering them by the knowledg of the truth from Idolatry.</hi>
                     </q> To which I anſwer, By both. The goodneſs of God is not extended to faln man but by Chriſts death.

<pb n="255" facs="tcp:117749:146"/>That there muſt be a price is evident, and I finde no other price mentioned in the New Teſtament, but the blood of Chriſt, either as ſhed, or as alſo teſtified; if Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> doth, let him ſhew it; for us to deviſe prices, is to add of our own heads to the Scriptures. Now if Chriſt be the price, its not material, whether we ſay that the Lord that bought them be God or Chriſt, the act of buying or purchaſing being attributed to both, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9. Chriſt buys men unto God, and God buys men by Chriſt. God gave Chriſt as a price to purchaſe men, and Chriſt gave himſelf for, and gives himſelf to men. And there are theſe two things in this buying, or price, by which people are bought. 1. Chriſt given by God and Himſelf to the Death for men, that they might be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and delivered and from the deſtruction due to them in <hi>Adam.</hi> 2. Chriſt given of God, and by Himſelf to them, in point of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and free offer, as in <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.32. and (at leaſt) good things given unto them, by and through him. And as I underſtand, none are ſaid in Scripture to be bought or redeemed from their vain converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or unto God from men, till this price made known to them, buy them off from their love to thoſe other things, and ingage them for God to be his. Thence men reaſon inconſequently, from thoſe Scriptures which ſay By the blood of Chriſt, men out of all Nations, Peoples, or Families, are bought or redeemed to God,
<note place="margin">As that in Rev. 5.9. and 14.4. and 1 Pet. 1.18, 19.</note> which ſpeak of the efficacy of his blood declared and believed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging their hearts and ſpirits to and for God (as <hi>Hoſea</hi> bought him a wife by a price given her, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.2.) to deny the extent of Chriſts given himſelf a ranſom, and dying for men. Theſe two things then I underſtand in this place of <hi>Peter.</hi> 1. That God had given Chriſt to the death, and he gave himſelf a ranſom for theſe falſe Teachers amongſt all the reſt of men, and thereby they, with all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, were delivered from periſhing in that ſentence of death which ſhould in <hi>Adam</hi> have (elſe) deſtroyed them, and had with others their liberty to the Church and Kingdom of Chriſt. 2. That God in the Goſpel preſenting this his love unto them, and this his Son that dyed for them (or the Son preſenting himſelf ſo) and ſo as the onely Lord and Saviour, able and ready to ſave them, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of ſalvation upon their ſubmiſſion to him, bought them, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingaged their hearts from their former idols, worſhips, vain and evil ways (called, ver. 20. the pollutions of the world) and had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged and purchaſed their affections to his Goſpel, People, Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:117749:147"/>and Glory ſet before them, and ſo to the ſervice of him; and they now after all this denying him (as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> after their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily redemption did. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.6.) <q>
                        <hi>They brought upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction.</hi>
                     </q> If Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> would faſten any other ſenſe upon this place, he muſt ſhew us that any people are ſaid to be bought or redeemed from their vain converſations (as theſe were <hi>ver.</hi> 20. for ſuch are the pollutions of the world) by any other price then the bloud of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. or 2. That ſome are bought with that for whom it was never ſhed. That God glorifies it to, and purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes thoſe by it for whom it hath done nothing, nor ſhall do any thing; for we have proved and do believe him to have dyed for All. If he perform either of thoſe two things, we ſhall liſten further to his expoſition. Whereas he ſayes "<hi>The word</hi>

How Lord but by dying for them eſpecially? how elſe a Saviour? Againe, did God give them any thing in that truth made known to them worthy their forſaking the world for him? had they
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:117749:147"/>any ſhare, right, intereſt in that truth, namely in the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> was there any good for them to get there? (for to be ſure the worlds good they were not like to get by that knowledge in thoſe dayes.) If yes, then whence proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that if he never dyed for them, if it declared no ſalvation as at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable by them? would men leave all and expoſe themſelves to perſecutions for meer uncertainties, when they could not be told that Chriſt had done any thing for them, or God by Chriſt? or that Chriſt was a Mediator for them to attaine to happineſſe by? If they had no right to the truth, nor that had any thing of goodneſſe in it for them, what had they to doe with that truth that ſo little concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them? If he ſay it had matter of advantage in it, for them for ought they knew, they might think it had though it had not. Then I anſwer, they had made but a blind bargain, and they knew not the Lord and Saviour <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> It was rather a miſtake about him that gave them that eſcape from the worlds pollutions, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny knowledge of him; had they known him rightly, they ſhould have known that they had no ſuch reaſon to let all go for him that had excluded them his mediation, and could not ſave them, not having dyed for them: And then having made ſome try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and not finding that which they had miſtakingly look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, but that he was a dry tree and barren wilderneſs to them; was it not more excuſable that they ſhould leave him and take ſuch comforts as the world would afford them, and not go on to ſuffer for him that would not ſave them, he having not dyed for them? <q>
                        <hi>Whereas he further adds, that the Apoſtle is ſilent about waſhing them in the bloud of the Lamb;</hi>
                     </q> what a ſorry ſhift is that? How many places ſpeak of buying men, and yet mention not the waſhing them in the bloud of the Lamb, where yet there is no doubt but his bloud was the price that bought them; as to inſtance, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.4. &amp; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. Again, What is it to waſh in the bloud of the Lamb? I feare there may be ſome miſtake in that. Is it any thing elſe, but when the death, ſufferings or bloud of Chriſt declared in the Goſpel &amp; ſet home by the Spirit, do cauſe the heart for his loves ſake that ſo loved it, to renounce its vanities, affections, luſts &amp;c. and removes its fears, deſpairs, horrors, &amp;c. that the guilt of ſin before the remedy was known filled it with? do we think that this waſhing the ſouls in the bloud of <hi>Jeſus</hi> is without appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the bloud to it? Was there ever ſuch a waſhing heard
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:117749:148"/>of, in which the <hi>medium</hi> of the waſhing and the thing waſhed, were not to each other applyed? Or do we fancy any bodily or materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all application of the materiall bloud of Chriſt that iſſued out of his ſide? Sure its nothing but through the Spirits revelation of the death and ſufferings of Chriſt for us, and the hope therein ſet before us, a cleanſing of the heart and conſcience from guilt and pollution. And is not that intimated here? Is not the knowledge of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> Lord and Saviour, to know him as one that dyed for us, and is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be our Mediator and way to God, able and ready to ſave us by vertue of thoſe his ſufferings for us? could there be leſſe in that knowledge of Chriſt that will give a man eſcape from the worlds pollutions? and when that knowledge doth waſh from pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, is it not the bloud of Chriſt therein known that waſhes? Was not that it that waſhed <hi>Paul</hi> from his former conceits in his Phariſaiſme and from all his pollutions? <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.7, 8, 9. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.4, 5, 6. and that waſhed the believing <hi>Corinths,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. becauſe he names but the knowledge of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and the appearance of Gods love to man, the name of Chriſt and Spirit of God as the way of his and their waſhings, ſhall we ſay neither he nor they were waſhed in the bloud of Chriſt? Theſe are ſorry evaſions, unmeet to ſhift off the ſhining truth with. 3. <q>
                        <hi>But his laſt evaſion is vainer then any of theſe,</hi> viz. <hi>That he might ſpeak of them only <gap reason="foreign">

                     </q> for which he quotes again that formerly anſwered place of 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.23. As if the Apoſtle writing Dogmatically, and laying down Propheticall declarations of things that would be, and aggravating the hainouſneſs of their ſinne that ſhould deny Chriſt, ſhould conjoyn things according to truth not conjungible. If he had ſpoken of ſome particular perſon then in being, there had been ſomewhat more ſhew for ſuch an eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and yet in truth not enough to make the Apoſtle couple as incompatible things together in his expreſſions, as to talk of Chriſts or his Elects periſhing. But much leſſe colour when he ſpeaks of things in the Theory and Dogmatically, not with Deſignation of this or that perſon. This is but all one as to ſay, Chriſt (or God) ſeemed but to be their Lord and Maſter, and they to be his ſervants by way of purchaſe, and ſo they had the more ground of denying him, ſeeing he was not what he ſeemed to be, nor had done what he ſeemed to do. And whereas he addes <q>
                        <hi>That its the cuſtome of the Scripture to aſcribe all thoſe things to every one that are in fellowſhip
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:117749:148"/>of the Church, which are proper to them only that are true ſpirituall members of it; as to be Saints, Elect, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> (Not to examine the truth of that again) were it ſo, yet it could not be of force here; theſe in the very formality of them as the ſubject ſpoken of being ſtiled falſe Teachers. Sure though he might write to All in fellowſhip with the Church (that is in Doctrine and Profeſſion) as Saints &amp;c. as in ſome ſenſe they were truly, yet its not ſuppoſeable that he judged theſe he looks upon as departed from the Truth, and falſe Teachers, to be ſuch, or to be bought by Chriſt, if he thought indeed ſuch manner of people were never ſo bought. To be a member of the Church, and to be Elect, are terms very competible, but to be (and ſo to be ſpoken of) as a falſe Teacher bringing ſwift deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on himſelf, and yet in the ſame view to be looked upon and ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of as bought by the Lord, if no ſuch are indeed bought, is <hi>compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere non componenda,</hi> to couple words and things together that are we not competible, like thoſe that talk of Almighty nothings. So that wee ſee no ſolidity in his exceptions to this place neither.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>Whereas in his winding up he tels us that this will not conclude Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall Redemption, and</hi> 2. <hi>That thoſe who are ſo redeemed may pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, is contrary to expreſſe Scripture, and</hi> 3. <hi>That this could be no peculiar aggravation of the ſin of any, if the matter was common to All.</hi>
                     </q> Theſe are but prevarications. For 1. We conclude not hence the univerſality of Chriſts death, but onely that its not ſo bounded up to the Elect onely as Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> and his partners bound it. 2. That its contrary to expreſſe Scripture, as to <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.4. That any ſo redeemed ſhould periſh, is a ſpeech fallacious and untrue. For 1. How knows he that that in <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.4. is expreſſe Scripture and ſpeaks according to truth, and not only according to appearance more then this? might not we by as good Authority ſay that the Apoſtle ſpeaks there but according as things ſeemed to him in a viſion, but not that all he ſayes there is ſpoken according to truth, as he hath to ſay ſo of <hi>Peter</hi> here? 2. What means he by So redeemed? if only that Chriſt dyed really for them, and not in ſhew only, and that the knowledge hereof, and of that ſalvation that thereby is in him (even for them to look after, and attainable to them by Faith) bought them really off from the world, and engaged them to Chriſt, then there is no ſuch paſſage in <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.4. as that none ſuch can periſh. That ſpeaks onely of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number redeemed from the earth, and men that were virgins
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:117749:149"/>and defiled not themſelves, but followed the Lamb where ever he went. But it ſays not, either that All bought by Chriſt, and brought to eſcape the pollutions of the world by the knowledge of him, do keep themſelves ſuch unſpotted Virgins, and walk conſtantly after Chriſt, nor that they ſhal All be ſaved. Not a ſyllable to that purpoſe. It ſays thoſe 144000. did keep themſelves Virgins pure and chaſte to him, and that they overcame and triumphed according to the promiſes ſet before the Churches in general. But theſe falſe Teachers did not ſo, but returned back again to their pollutions, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though bought (yea, the rather for that) they ſhould be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I wonder that men have no more fear of God before them, then to ſay the Scripture expreſſes ſuch things as are not expreſſed in it, and in the mean time tell us, they are but appearances (like ſeeming dreams) that are expreſſed. 3. How this is a peculiar aggravation of their ſin, may be ſeen by what is ſaid above, <hi>viz.</hi> in that it hath more in it then meerly a dying for them, yea, more then is common to every one, eſpecially in the degree of their being bought. As al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo further, in that all do not ſo diſſerve him that bought them, no not all of them that periſh, as theſe that by falſe doctrine ſhould deny him, and lead many others into the tranſgreſſion with themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The laſt place is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. of how much ſorer puniſhment ſhall he be thought worthy, who counts the blood of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted a common thing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He ſhould have done well to have taken in <hi>ver.</hi> 26. alſo. <hi>If we ſin willingly after the knowledg of the Truth received, there remains no more ſacrifice for ſin,</hi> &amp;c. And told us whether ſuch a one as ſo ſins had any ſacrifice before his ſo ſinning or not? and ſo whether they deprived themſelves of any benefit they might have otherwiſe had by Chriſts Sacrifice. I have asked one or two that queſtion from whom I could never yet get anſwer to it. But let us view what he ſays to that other verſe. He tells us <q>
                        <hi>Its an argument to perſwade to continuance in the Goſpel-Doctrine taken</hi> ab incommodo, <hi>and that</hi> 1. <hi>He ſpeaks here onely of profeſſors of the Gospel, and ſo it cannot be applied to All</hi>
                     </q> [thats granted, nor do we ſo apply it, but to prove that mens periſhing for whom Chriſt died, is a thing that the Apoſtles ſuppoſed, and ſo that Doctrine that confines Chriſts Death to them onely that ſhall be eternally ſaved, is erroneous] <q>2. <hi>That the Apoſtle aſſerts not what is, or may be, but onely adds a commination upon a ſuppoſition,</hi>
                     </q> (to deter from a thing impoſſible, he ſhould have ſaid) but if the Apoſtles ſpeech
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:117749:149"/>doth not imply a poſſibility for one that is ſanctified by the blood of Chriſt, to count it a common thing, and ſo to fall into condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; yea, if this doth not ſometime fall out, how is it that men generally make uſe of this place to deſcribe the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt that is unpardonable? Is there not ſuch a ſin as that? or do they take incompatible and impoſſible expreſſions to deſcribe it? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, if the deſcription be of impoſſibilities, and things that never fall out, then the thing defined is of that nature too. Again, will any ſay that its never found that any man tramples Chriſt under his feet, that is, deſpiſes and ſcorns him? or that none ever deſpite the Spirit of Grace? I ſuppoſe all will agree that theſe things (ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at leaſt) are committed. And why then ſhall we think that the expreſſions of either ſide are ſuppoſitions of things that may be, and ſometimes are, and onely think otherwiſe of this that lies between them, and is as much ſuppoſed as either of them? Either let us ſay they are none of them poſſible, or elſe ſay they are all ſo, or ſhew ſome weighty ground to the contrary. He tells us <q>
                        <hi>Paul ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that if the Marriners left the Ship,</hi> Acts 27. <hi>they could not be ſaved, and yet it was not poſſible that they ſhould not be drowned, becauſe God had told him he had given him all that were in the ſhip with him.</hi>
                     </q> But, firſt, that concludes not this ſuppoſition to be of a thing impoſſible, at leaſt no more then it doth the other too, that before it, and that after it, or then it doth any other ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Scripture, it being to another buſineſs. Secondly, That ſaying of God might not hold forth to <hi>Paul</hi> that it was impoſſible they ſhould any of them be drowned. For <hi>Paul</hi> was not unacquainted that God oftentimes in ſuch ſpeeches intimates a condition. As when he told <hi>David</hi> that <hi>Saul</hi> would come to <hi>Keilah,</hi> and the men of <hi>Keilah</hi> deliver him up, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.11, 12. and yet neither of them came to paſs, becauſe there was intimately, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. this condition in his Anſwers, <hi>viz.</hi> if <hi>David</hi> ſtaid there. So he told <hi>Ely,</hi> that his houſe, and the houſe of his Father ſhould walk before him for ever, yet he after tells him it ſhould not be ſo, becauſe he had not hearkned to him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.30. ſo he ſaid by <hi>Jonas, Yet forty days and Niniveh ſhall be deſtroyed;</hi> and yet there being a condition implyed in it, they were not deſtroyed, <hi>Jonah</hi> 3. and 4. So <hi>Paul</hi> knew how to interpret Gods Sayings, that they held forth a certainty of the event upon ſubmiſſion to him, by them to whom they were ſpoken, in the uſe of ſuch means as he ſets before men, but yet include a poſſibility
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:117749:150"/>of miſſing, upon tempting him, or rebelling againſt him; and ſo he might well ſay, Except theſe men abide in the ſhip, ye cannot have Gods Promiſe accompliſhed, ye cannot be ſaved. God doth not ſo promiſe us an end, thats that to be attained, though we tempt him, and reject the means; as clearly appears by multitudes of the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious <hi>Iſraelites</hi> failing of the promiſed <hi>Canaan.</hi> Yea, the words, <hi>I have given to thee all that are in the ſhip with thee,</hi> might ſignifie a giving their lives into his hand, ſo that he uſing the means pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of God to him, they ſhould be preſerved, but his neglect of them might have been a willing throwing away, or letting go what God had given him. Again, thirdly, the caſe is different in this, That there <hi>Paul</hi> had a promiſe of all their lives, but I know no one word that ſays, none of them that Chriſt died for, or that are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in any degree by his blood can or ſhall periſh. That they that believe in him, hear his voyce, and follow him, ſhall not, its confeſt; but in thoſe ſpeeches there is intimated an abiding, and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, for elſe its an evident caſe they would not. But that all that do at any time, in any meaſure or degree believe, or that at any time hear his voyce, ſhall alwayes do ſo, or that they that in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree are ſanctified, ſhall perſevere therein to the end, and cannot neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Gods Salvation, and by willing neglects fall away, I finde no Scripture that affirms it, but much to the contrary. That he hath for ever perfected by his Sacrifice thoſe that are ſanctified, is true, if either we look upon perfection as provided in himſelf for them, <hi>viz.</hi> that thereby they are ſo compleatly furniſhed with all things needful for them, that they need not to turn any whither elſe for any perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, he being a fountain of living waters for them: or if we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it of his former dealings in all times propounded as an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement for our abiding in him, he hath for ever perfected his ſanctified ones by that one Sacrifice, and therefore we may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably attend to him, in and by that, for perfecting us alſo, nothing being able to keep us from that perfection to be had in, and by it, but our renouncing that that is appointed for our perfection. That many do believe for a time, and turn away again, is affirmed in Scripture, as alſo that that faith was operative in them to make them rejoyce and ſpring up as the green corn on the ſtony ground, yea, to purge them from their former ſins, to give them to eſcape the pollutions of the world through luſt, to make them devote them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which I think is that the Apoſtle calls their ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification.
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:117749:150"/>So that, except Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> can produce a Scripture that ſays, That All that are ever ſanctified by the bloud of the Covenant, ſhall not, nor can periſh, but ſhall be eternally ſaved, his inſtance is not parallel with this in hand. <q>
                        <hi>That admonitions and warnings of things that in regard of Gods purpoſe, ſhall never come to paſs,</hi>
                     </q> are not in vain and fruitleſs, we grant: it being ſuppoſed that ſuch a purpoſe hath appointed to keep off ſuch an iſſue by ſuch admonitions &amp; thoſe admonitions and warnings being taken and ſubmitted to by them to they are given. But that ever God ſo purpoſed concerning all that at any time or in any degree are ſanctified, and that none ſuch ever do, or can reject ſuch warnings and fall away, is the thing in queſtion and to be proved, Firſt, before we can grant that ſo it is here, and that that ſtrengthens our conception to the contrary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide what is ſaid above, is what the Apoſtle ſays <hi>ver.</hi> 25. where he tels us ſome were in thoſe waies that lead to this back-ſliding, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to whom he admoniſhes them the more earneſtly and backs this warning with theſe threatnings.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <q>3. <hi>He tels us that theſe made profeſſion of all theſe things, and that an open renouncing theſe, deſerved ſuch a commination, though the Apoſtates never had any ſuch true intereſt in the bloud of Chriſt, &amp;c:</hi>
                     </q> But I anſwer that their profeſſing ſuch things as they had not, is both a deviſe of which the Text ſpeaketh nothing, and it comes not up to the caſe by the Apoſtle propounded, nor ſuites with the type to which he alludes; for he alludes to the people in the wilderneſs that were really delivered from the Egyptian bondage, and had the bloud of the Old Covenant ſprinkled upon them as really as others, though they made not ſo good an uſe of it, nor were perſwaded to ſuch ſtedfaſtneſſe in the Covenant by it; he ſpeaks of ſuch deſpiſing the Law as the Law it ſelf declares. Now to match with this ſuch as onely boaſted of thoſe things but Chriſt never did any of them to them, and ſo that had no ſuch reall ingagement to <hi>Chriſt</hi> as they had to <hi>Moſes,</hi> is unparallel. Beſide, the caſe propounded is thus; what ſuch a one is worthy of that being ſo ſanctified ſhould deſpiſe that bloud that ſanctified him; not what he is worthy of, that never having ſuch an engagement to that bloud, but onely boaſting himſelf of it ſhould deſpiſe it, ſo that thats impertinent too.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <q>4. <hi>He ſaith, It was the manner of the Saints and Apoſtles to ſpeak of all baptized perſons as ſanctified, and ſo mentions back-ſliders as they were eſteemed ſo to be.</hi>
                     </q> To which I anſwer as before, that that is
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:117749:151"/>to make the Apoſtles not to write in things Dogmaticall and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinall after an infallible Spirit, but after a fallible judgement of their own and other mens. Beſides, the Scriptures ſay not they ſo judged of any in their writings that were not ſo. But ſuppoſe they did ſo, yet after what rule walked they in ſo doing? He ſays in <hi>Chap</hi> 1. the rule of charity, to which I anſwer, that that might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be ground for ſo ſpeaking of men while they walked in the Doctrine and Profeſſion of the Church; but no ground for ſo ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Apoſtates as ſuch. Thats not charity, to ſuppoſe that a man that doth ſo trample under foot the Son of God, ſin wilfully after the knowledge of the truth, &amp;c. to have ever been ſanctified by the bloud of Chriſt, if they that ſo do never were or could be ſo; or if thoſe that ever were ſo, could never do as is here ſuppoſed.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <q>
                        <hi>He ſays if the Text be interpreted poſitively, and according to the truth of the thing, then theſe two things follow.</hi> 1 <hi>Faith, and Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are not the fruits of Election.</hi>
                     </q> 
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> That follows not, but onely this, That then All Faith and Sanctification are not the fruits of ſuch an Election as he ſpeaks of. And thats true enough. For I ſuppoſe he will ſay the faith in them that fell away, compared to the ſpringing up of ſeed on ſtony ground, was not the fruit of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; nor yet that goodneſs of conſcience that ſome put away, nor that eſcaping of pollutions that others fell from, all which I look upon as equivalent to this ſanctification, and indeed to be the very thing here ſpoken of. 2. "<hi>That believers may fall finally away,</hi> which I do believe they may, ſuch as we have ſpoken of, and I think Chriſt himſelf implies it too; and all that Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> can ſay cannot diſprove it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <q>He ſays: <hi>Nothing in the Text inforces that theſe perſons ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of muſt needs be truly juſtified and regenerated believers, much leſſe, that Chriſt dyed for them, but onely by ſtrained conſequences.</hi>
                     </q> The firſt part of which is not to our purpoſe, how far they were believers or how regenerated; but for the latter of them, that Chriſt dyed for them will inevitably follow, both from that its ſaid There remains no more ſacrifice for ſin upon ſuch ſinning, which to me implies that there was one for them till then; and alſo in that ſuch are ſaid to have been ſanctified by the bloud of the Covenant; except he can ſhew that ever the bloud of a ſacrifice ſanctified any for whom and whoſe ſanctification it was never ſhed. Whereas he ſays <q>
                        <hi>The ancients called Baptiſme.</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:117749:151"/>which by a ſolemn aſperſion of the ſymbole of the bloud of Chriſt, they were externally ſanctified &amp; ſet apart &amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> intimating that the Apoſtle might mean but that too, its too weak. He ſhould tell us how the Apoſtles uſe to call things, not how other Ancients; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly that the Apoſtles ever call the outward Baptiſme or the Water in it the bloud of Chriſt, and their Baptiſme the being ſanctified by that bloud though it was never ſhed for them; elſe he ſays nothing. For the Apoſtle ſay's not, the ſymbole of the bloud, but the bloud of the Covenant ſanctified him. Again he he ſays <q>
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <hi>in Scripture frequently ſignifies to Conſecrate and ſet apart to Holy uſe.</hi>
                     </q> True, I believe thats always in the ſignification of it, or its very ſeldome (if ever) otherwiſe, and ſo the bloud of the Covenant is ſuppoſed to have ſanctified theſe; but that he calls an appearing, counterfeit ſanctitie, ſanctification, here I deſire his proof for it before I can yeeld it. But his concluſion from all this is moſt impertinent, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>That then no true, real, internal ſanctification proper to Gods Elect, is here intimated.</hi>
                     </q> For, 1. The moſt true, real, ſpeciall ſanctification accompanying Election, is a ſetting them apart to Holy, to moſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſe, and conſiſts more primarily in that then in any thing elſe, and is reſembled by thoſe phraſes uſed of old about the Temple. 2. Who can imagine that we in this Argument endeavour to prove that ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification here ſignifies a ſanctification proper to the Elect, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour hence to prove that others beſides the Elect had the bloud of Chriſt, not only ſhed for them, but alſo in ſome meaſure operative in them ſo as to ſanctifie them? and yet we deny that this ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying was but a meer externall ſetting apart to the enjoyment of Ordinances. The Apoſtle tels us in that parallel place of <hi>Heb.</hi> 6 4, 5. they might taſte the good word of God, and of the powers of the world to come, and partake of the Holy Ghoſt; and <hi>Peter,</hi> that they eſcaped the pollutions of the world, which is more then a ſetting apart to Ordinances onely. And let this ſuffice to this Chapter.</p>

                        <hi>Some Obſervations upon, and Replies to his Anſwers to the</hi> 20. <hi>Chapt. of</hi> T. M. <hi>

                  </argument>
                  <p>HIs 6. Chapter hath little in it (though it be very long) but what is anſwered before; it containing an Anſwer to the 20. Chap. of <hi>T. M.</hi> Book, Intituled the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality of Gods love, &amp;c.</hi> is much of it but a Repetition of things ſpoken to before (as that Chapter occaſioned) with much inſulting and accuſing Rhetorick a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him he anſwers. Therefore I ſhall onely take notice of here and there a paſſage in it, eſpecially thoſe that are not before ſpoken to, that I may not repeat, nor grow over-tedious. <q>
                        <hi>In his firſt page of it, he charges our Doctrine with diſcrepancie from the word, &amp; ſelf-contradiction,</hi> but produces not one place or thing in which his charge is made good;</q> in the mean time we have ſhewed his not only diſcrepant from, but point-blank contradictory to the word God, as much as For All, and Not for All, can be contradictory. He tels us <hi>p.</hi> 4. of this <hi>Cha.</hi> (that is of his book the 261.) <q>
                        <hi>that they ſay not that the Scripture in one place reſtrains what is in another place ſpoken more largely, as if in ſome places its ſaid for All men, and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers not for All; but one place expounds another in it; as thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that ſay, He dyed for his Sheep and Church; &amp;c. declare what that All is for whom he is ſaid to die.</hi>
                     </q> The firſt part of which is very true, and we have made uſe of it; the ſecond very falſe and without all proof. Such a way of Interpreting it is, as did we apply it to any other thing almoſt, we ſhould evidently deſtroy the faith. For by the ſame rule we might ſay, that the Scripture ſaith he dyed for his Church and Sheep &amp;c. but when he ſaith he dyed for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, the unjuſt, All men; he declares who are his Church and Sheep, <hi>viz.</hi> the ungodly, unjuſt, the enemies of God and in a word, All men. So again the Scripture ſaith, God made all Nations, and all men, and we believe it; but then when he ſays he made <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that is, the Elect of all Nations, who are called the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds who are the All that he made. So, All that are in their graves ſhall come forth, that is true and we believe it; but when its ſaid <hi>they that are Chriſts ſhall riſe at his coming, and them that ſleep in Jeſus
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:117749:152"/>will God bring with him,</hi> thats the Interpretation of that All that ſhall riſe So <hi>God is good to All, Pſa.</hi> 145.9. that is he is good only to <hi>Iſrael. Pſal.</hi> 73.1. This is the way of Mr. <hi>Owens</hi> interpreting, which deſerves as bad Rhetorick as he can give <hi>T.M.</hi> But I will not reta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate in that kind with him; onely I will reach him back his admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition. <q>
                        <hi>Oh let not M. Owen be of them that corrupt the word of God.</hi>
                     </q> In the cloſe of the ſame page he ſays, <q>

Its Gods will that the believer in it be ſanctified by it. But if he means that his act of dying ſanctifies us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>before believing (except in that ſenſe that <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of, when he ſaith <hi>God taught him to call no man unclean or common, Act.</hi> 10.28.) then he contradicts his own expreſſions againſt the <hi>Socinians, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. <hi>pag.</hi> 151. and he goes beſide the expreſſion of the Scripture.

                  <p>He often quarrels with his reaſoning and frame of Arguments, where they are as good or better then the greateſt part of his own; as in his 4th Argument, he quarrels with him for not bringing in the <hi>Medius terminus</hi> over again in the concluſion; as any that compare his laſt note upon that Argument, with the Argument it ſelf, may ſee. And I think thats a great fault in reaſoning, and that which he elſwhere faults him for. But I think P. or Paſſion blinded his reaſon; or elſe God let him fall into that overſight, that he might ſee that ſome grains of charity are needful to be afforded to them we deal withall, becauſe we our ſelves may have the like or greater infirmities then thoſe we reprove in others.</p>

For the challenge he after makes, I have undertaken it here with him, though not in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very paſſage <hi>in terminis;</hi> but thus, I will maintain that the death of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> had not onely the Elect and them that ſhall be ſaved eternally for its object; but was in generall a ranſome for All men: and that Chriſt hath thereby obtained life and ſalvation in himſelf, free for all men, or any man to look to him for, and to partake of in believing.

Free-will, further then God frees it, and Merit of congruity we utterly diſclaim, and what he calls the Arminian Univerſall grace, we well underſtand not.

                     </q> Whence his Query; How a man may have a Will given him to believe, and not believe, is groundleſs, as to his Diſcourſe, and needs no anſwering. But he further denies, <q>
                        <hi>That any internal aſſiſtance is required to render a man excuſeleſs for not believing, if he have the object of faith propounded to him, though of himſelf he hath neither Power nor Will of himſelf ſo to do, having loſt both in</hi> Adam.</q> To which I ſay, 1. Man having power to attend the outward <hi>Mediums</hi> of faith in which the Spirit uſeth to convey Light, Underſtanding, Convincement, and to draw men to believe, if he neglect them, he is inexcuſeably chargeable with unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, though he never had internal Power or Will given him of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving. He that diſpiſes the means that are ſuited to his power, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſes the end propounded in the means, and may be charged for not attaining it; this I believe. And this Anſwers in part to one grand objection of our oppoſers; Have men power to believe? We ſay thats no matter, let them hear, and attend in means afforded, and as God convinces in them, let them confeſs their follies, and turn in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provings according to that ability he gives them, more or leſs, <hi>

Again, it was a vain thing that a man ſhould have Power and Will to that which was not for him in that condition; nay, which he could not come to have need of, but by loſing that condition in which he had that power and will, and ſo the power and will alſo ſuppoſed to be had therein: we uſe to ſay, <hi>Deus &amp; natura nihil faciunt fruſtra.</hi> Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> muſt bring ſome proof for that more then his bare affirmation, before it will paſs with us for an Article of our Creed.</p>

He asks of whom, or to whom he ſpeaks: and he anſwers, doubtleſly he ſpeaks to the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> only, which as its not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, ſo is it unſatisfactory too. For the perſons ſpoken of in a Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, may be of larger extent then the perſons ſpoken to. As to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, The Apoſtle ſpeaking to the believing <hi>Epheſians. Chap.</hi> 5.3, 4, 5. Bids <hi>them flee fornication, wantonneſs,</hi> &amp;c. for ſaith he, <hi>for ſuch things comes the wrath of God upon the children of diſobedience.</hi> Shal we ſay that becauſe he ſpeaks to the believers at <hi>Epheſus</hi> only, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.1. therefore that ſaying, <hi>The wrath of God comes upon the children of diſobedience,</hi> is true concerning them onely? Or becauſe in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9. he ſpeaks to the believing <hi>Corinths</hi> only, or at moſt, but to believers that call upon the Name of the Lord Jeſus, therefore that propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>No unrighteous perſon ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> extends to them only to whom he ſpeaketh, <hi>Ver.</hi> 25. So becauſe its ſaid, <hi>Hear now O houſe of</hi> Iſrael, therefore the extent of the Propoſition, <hi>ver</hi> 11. is but this, <hi>He delights not in the death of the houſe of</hi> Iſrael, as Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> makes it; as if the wicked, and the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible tearms, and equipollent, and of equal latitude. Is not this fallacious arguing? The <hi>medium</hi> brought to prove a Concluſion is not of greater extent then the Concluſion? or the <hi>Minor</hi> Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be the meaſure of the <hi>Majors</hi> quantity? as if becauſe going to prove a lye to be avoided, the <hi>Minor</hi> is but this, A lye is a ſin, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Major, viz.</hi> that ſin is to be avoided, extends no further then to the ſin of lying. Who knows not, that its uſuall with the Prophets and Apoſtles from indefinite and univerſal propoſitions of truth, to infer particular inſtructions and reprehenſions? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As from this, God gives liberally to All, to infer, <hi>If any of you want wiſdom, ask it of God,</hi> Jam. 1.5. <hi>The man is bleſſed that truſts in God, therefore taſte ye, and ſee how good he is,</hi> Pſal. 34.8. And ſuch is the Prophets way here. The people deſpair becauſe of Gods judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:117749:154"/>threatned, or repine at his chaſtiſements. God indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely by his Prophet lays open his good-will towards men, and thence exhorts them to take heart to ſeek and turn to him. Thus, God delights not in the death of the wicked, but that they rather turn and live, therefore not in your death, therefore turn and live; that that is Gods way in general, may make for your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and incouragement in particular. Now 2. <q>
                        <hi>Whereas he asks what will, that is, that God wills not the death of the wicked in.</hi>
                     </q> I anſwer, as before, his Will of welpleaſedneſs, as the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies. Its not deſirable or approveable, that wicked men go on in ſinful ways and dye, but rather turn and live. And this may be true even of thoſe that have not ſuch expreſs commands and Revelations of his minde as others. God would not have them ſmother what truth they have, but glorifie him according to what they know of him, and be thankful, &amp; ſeek him, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18, 19.21. <hi>Act.</hi> 17.26, 27. 3. He tells us, <q>
                        <hi>We miſerably miſtake the meaning of the Prophet, becauſe he ſpeaks but about temporal judgements upon their land,</hi> &amp;c.</q> I anſwer, That he ſpeaks about them is true; but that he ſpeaks but about them, and that the word <hi>(death)</hi> holds forth there no more but temporal death, and the word <hi>(live)</hi> but a natural earthy life and proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as if he might have pleaſure in their eternal death, though not in their temporal, and as if he delighted not to give them eternal life upon their repentance, or, as if the Propoſition is but true of the outward, becauſe applied to comfort them, in that alſo theſe things, I ſay, are untrue, and I deny them. Did the putting away their evils, and turning to God, and making them new hearts, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect only their avoiding temporal judgements, and living in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward happineſs, when the Scripture often tels us, That it pleaſes God many times to confer outward happineſs upon, and keep off temporal judgments from thoſe that never think of turning, but live in all wickedneſs. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.1, 3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Job</hi> 20.7, 8.9, 13. Surely from Gods not delighting in the death of ſinners any way, may be argued, that he deſires not their deſtruction from this life; as from Gods wrath coming upon the children of diſobedience, that then the believers diſobeying ſhould be ſorely chaſtened, and yet ſore chaſtiſements here, not be all thats contained in the word <hi>wrath,</hi> as affirmed to come on the children of diſobedience; theſe are frothy arguments, and not beſeeming Mr. <hi>Owen.</hi> Its more frothy to limit an indefinite Propoſition to ſome few particulars, where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:117749:155"/>inforces it, as to draw from thence a Concluſion general. Nay, indefinite propoſitions are moſt uſually of general ſignification (as might eaſily be ſhewed) in the Scriptures: but I leave that to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Readers. Only minding them, that this is by the Apoſtles <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Peter</hi> affirmed in the general, as in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3 9. So that Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> here hath ſaid nothing to purpoſe. He ſays (<hi>p.</hi> 283.) <q>
                        <hi>That the ends of the earth,</hi> Iſa. 45.22. <hi>are they that look up to God.</hi>
                     </q> A ſtrange Collection, he might as well ſay [from <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55.7, 8. <hi>Let the wicked forſake his ways</hi>] That the wicked are they that forſake their ways and turn to God. If the perſons exhorted are always the performers of what they are exhorted to, that would be wonderfull. And yet he ſays that his gloſſe is beyond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall; and again, "<hi>That onely Elect and Believers are there,</hi> and in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 49.6. clearly intimated. I marvell by what Argument he can demonſtrate it, that we may not deny it: Sure his <hi>ipſe Dico</hi> is not enough for it, and yet thats all he brings to prove it.</p>
                  <p>He tels us <hi>p.</hi> 287. <q>
                        <hi>That its moſt certain that the Lord Jeſus ſends not his ſervants with a lye, to offer that to all that belongs but to ſome, and asks what is thence concluded.</hi>
                     </q> I anſwer, That <hi>M. O.</hi> is in an error then, in ſaying, The Death of Chriſt is onely for the Elect; For if the Lord Chriſt ſent not his Servants to offer that to All, that belongs only to a few, and yet he ſent the Goſpel with the Contents thereof to be offered to All, then it follows, that that that is therein offered pertains not onely to ſome few. For otherwiſe he grants, they that ſo offer it are ſent with a lye. That its offered to All, he grants partly here, and partly in <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. where he ſaid <q>
                        <hi>The Goſpel is to be preached to All Nations, and hath a right to be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to every creature.</hi>
                     </q> Therefore unleſſe they that are to Preach it ſhould preach a lye, the Contents of it pertain not onely to ſome, but to All. "<hi>Quod erat probandum.</hi> Whereas he ſays, <q>
                        <hi>We are to prove that Chriſt dyed for All, aſwell them that never heard the Goſpel, as for them that do.</hi>
                     </q> I Anſwer, That pertains not to us; but to believe what Chriſt by his ſervants hath delivered to us; that he dyed for All and every one, and is the Propitiation for the ſins of the whole world: which is proof and ground enough for our believing that he dyed for them alſo, the phraſes being ſufficiently comprehenſive. If any will bring in that limitation to the Apoſtles expreſſion, they muſt ſhew us juſt warrant for ſo doing. Its enough to us to believe the generality and Univerſality of it, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:117749:155"/>never excludeth any from it, but in generall Univerſall phraſes affirmeth it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>In pag.</hi> 288. <hi>he ſpeaks as if</hi> T. M. <hi>affirmed that we are bound to pray for every ſingular man that he may be ſaved, and ſuppoſed that there is nothing elſe that we are to pray for men, but that they may be ſaved by Chriſt.</hi>
                     </q> Which (to give the mildeſt language) are more miſtakes of him; for as he affirmed neither of them in his proof to which <hi>M.O.</hi> Anſwers, as any that read it may ſee; ſo it ſuffices that we pray for all in generall, that God would reveal the knowledge of his truth unto them, and ſpread abroad his Goſpel amongſt them, and afford them ſuch teſtimonies of his goodneſs as may lead them to Repentance; and for what other things may concern their welfare here, the leſſe is no whit excluded by praying for the greater. Though indeed I know no warrant we have in all the Scripture to pray God to ſave eternally (that is, to give the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges proper to believers, to) them that have not yet believed. How <q>
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 8.22, 24. <hi>proves it falſe, that an aſſurance of Chriſt dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for men in particular, is not our ground of praying for them</hi>
                     </q> (as <hi>M.O.</hi> ſays) I am yet to learn, except he can prove that <hi>Peter</hi> was not aſſured that Chriſt dyed for <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> which he that extracts out of that place muſt be ſomewhat more skilfull in Chymeſtry then I am. Whereas <hi>pag.</hi> 290. he ſays, <q>
                        <hi>we turn the moſt intenſe and incomparable love of God towards his Elect, into a common deſire, wiſhing, and affection of his Nature, oppoſite to his Nature, and fayling of its end.</hi>
                     </q> Its a great miſtake as to us at leaſt, and to the party he there oppoſeth. We grant Gods love as intenſe and incomparable to his Elect, as he by any Scripture proof can make it, and far more incomparable then here he imputes to us. Whereas he ſays that in <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12. <q>
                        <hi>is not a common love,</hi>
                     </q> he begs that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion: for the words are the grace of God <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, ſaving to All men hath appeared. And if ſaving to All men, be not common, I know not what expreſſion can argue it common. And yet that then <q>

                     </q> is in my view as as great an inconſequence as that; If the Lords mighty power was a ſaving power to all the <hi>Iſralites</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> then it muſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſave them all, all the way into <hi>Canaan.</hi>

                     <hi>P.</hi> 292. He faults <hi>T. M.</hi> for rendring <q>
                        <hi>they love darkneſs rather then light,</hi>
                     </q> to be a chooſing darkneſs rather then light, which is a meer trifle, for he that loves one thing rather then another, prefers that thing and choſes it before the other. And whereas he adds, "<hi>that there is no compariſon inſtituted between their loving light and loving darkneſſe, as if they had loved both, but one more then the other;</hi> that nothing overthrows his ſaying. For where one thing is loved, and not another, there is choice alſo as well as when two things are loved one above another. And yet his denyall of their loving both is not true in all men that love darkneſſe. Many a man loves the truth in many things, and approves it, that yet loves his luſts more, and ſo prefers them before it; as thoſe that (<hi>Joh.</hi> 12.42.) <hi>Loved the praiſe of men more then the praiſe of God.</hi> There is no queſtion but they honored &amp; deſired the praiſe of God, but yet ſo, as that to have it they would not looſe the praiſe of men. So <hi>Herod</hi> reverenced <hi>Iohn,</hi> and bare good will to him, but yet preferred his <hi>Herodias</hi> before him. But whereas from that phraſe <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.19. <hi>T. M.</hi> inferred, ſurely there was light for them; <hi>M.O.</hi> trifles again about that, and ſays, <q>
                        <hi>He durſt not ſay that it was the counſel of God that they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it.</hi>
                     </q> To which I ſay, Sure it was his councell to them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, and they rejected the counſel of God againſt themſelves, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.30. <hi>Pro.</hi> 1.23, 25, 29, 30. Indeed what he councels or purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to do himſelf, or cauſe to be done, that ſhall ſtand, and ſo much that in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46.10. ſaith, But what he councels us to do, is not always done by us, though onely in his counſels obeyed there is ſtanding ſafety for us. But by [for them there was light] its evident <hi>T.M.</hi> meant it was preſented to them, as that that they had right to look upon and receive, yea, ought of duty to have received; And not onely it was a common ſtock, as light in the Sun for blind men, as
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:117749:156"/>
                     <hi>M.O.</hi> ſpeaketh, for theſe men ſee the light and ſomething in it that croſſed them in their purpoſes and deſigns, elſe would they not have hated it. Blind men take not delight in one colour more then in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, ſeeing they diſcern no difference, whereas there, and in <hi>p.</hi> 293. he ſays that theſe places of <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.26. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.9. make nothing againſt his poſition, nor for the extent of Chriſts Death, he is much miſtaken, or will not acknowledge what is preſented to him. He ſays, <hi>Jonas</hi> 2.8. tels us that they that <q>
                        <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake God, forfeit their mercies temporall and ſpiritual, which they had before received.</hi>
                     </q> But can any man be ſaid to receive a reall mercy from God, who have nothing from him but in hatred, &amp; with a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to aggravate their miſery, as is neceſſarily implyed by <hi>M.O.</hi> opinion, which tels us that God hated many from eternity, whom Chriſt dyed not for, and yet will judge them the more ſeverely for the abuſe of every thing they have, though given in that hatred. Count you that a mercy, to choak men with Gold, or to hang wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of it about their necks, and throw them into the Sea to drown them? have they any Spirituall mercies from God for whom Chriſt dyed not, and did he ſo in his opinion for Idolators and Back-ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from God? Beſides, he ſpeaks not out all the truth; for men not onely through obſerving lying vanities forſake what they have, but much that they might have had, as is plain, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.14, 15. <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.41. <hi>there are things pertaining to their peace,</hi> that they miſs off; and how could they had any ſuch things, if Chriſt never dyed for them, or was not Mediator for them? If it be ſaid that our Saviour ſpeaks thus of outward peace and mercies; beſides that thats too ſcanty an expoſition, ſeeing Chriſt preached the Kingdome of God to them, its no ſufficient evaſion: God uſually puniſhing men with deprivation of temporal mercies, for neglecting eternall, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.7. <q>
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12. He ſays <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5. <hi>ſpeaks of the Gentiles, who had the works of God to teach them, and the Patience of God to wait upon them, yet made bad uſe of both,</hi>
                     </q> which is too ſlender an Anſwer to the place. Could he not finde it in the Text that they led them to repentance? and can he ſhew us any ground of Repentance and change of mind, for any man that hath no cauſe in and from God for it, nothing better to be enjoyed by them in and with God, then what he ſets his mind upon already? or that any have any ſuch favours afforded them, as lead to Repentance, with whom God deals according to the ſentence pronounced upon All in <hi>Adam;</hi>
                     <pb n="276" facs="tcp:117749:157"/>and for whom Chriſt never came to procure any ſuch things for them: or that Chriſt procured ſuch things for any for whom he did not interpoſe himſelf between the Sentence of Death and them? Sure theſe things deſerve a little more conſideration then he affords them. Beſides that, they make againſt his expoſition of 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. where he would tye up Gods willing men to come to Repentance, to the Elect only; for here he ſpeaks of Gods goodneſs and patience, leading ſuch to Repent, as treaſure up wrath to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by occaſion of Gods goodneſs to them.
<note place="margin">Mat. 6.26. Mark 8.36.</note> Sure he will not tell us they are the Elect onely too. He makes little of thoſe expreſſions in which men are ſaid <hi>to loſe their own ſouls,</hi> but onely as if therein was intimated, "<hi>That they make the loſſe of them ſure to themſelves;</hi> then it ſeems it was not ſure enough to them in <hi>Adams</hi> ſinning; and why not? Sure <hi>Adam</hi> loſt us All ſure enough: If <hi>Chriſt</hi> did nothing for recovering them, they are loſt ſure enough, without any mans do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any more to looſe them. But perhaps he means that they make it evident to themſelves that Chriſt did nothing for them, and ſo that they remain loſt by <hi>Adam.</hi> Sure this is a new way of expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and before it paſs for currant, he muſt prove, that to loſe or ſave in Scripture ſignifies onely to make it evident that a thing was loſt or ſaved before-hand, or that we are ſaid to loſe by doing this or that, that that was loſt out of our power before we did that. As that if a Corporation have forfeited their Charter, and it was taken from them an hundred years ago, ſo that now they have none, yet they that are now of it do forfeit and loſe it by ſo doing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that they ſhould not; let him ſhew us that the Scripture ſpeaks in that language, and we ſhall liſten to his evaſion. His after Collection from <hi>T. M.</hi> is ſpoken to before, its but his own miſunderſtanding of him, and ſo are all his Inferences drawne from it.</p>
                  <p>For his Argument from Gods expoſtulations, <hi>pag.</hi> 296. it is to ſhew that God wils them to be ſaved, and delights not in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, which oppoſes <hi>M. Owens</hi> Interpretation of 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. and by conſequent intimates Chriſts interpoſing himſelf between God and them, there being no ſalvation to be had for any but in him, and thoſe expoſtulations being with others then the Elect, about looking and liſtning to him, &amp;c. What there is in God we cannot tell, but as the only begotten Son hath revealed to us, and that is indeed, that there is in him no imperfection. But that he deſires not thoſe

                     <pb n="279" facs="tcp:117749:157"/>ſalvation that miſs of, it he hath no where told us that I know of: but often the contrary, and yet that may be in him without imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. We are no competent Judges by our narrow conceptions of his perfections. There is that in and with him that ſeems foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſs to our wiſdome, and weakneſs in our judgements, that yet is wiſer and ſtronger then we can conceive of, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22, 23, 24. Its ſaucineſs in us to preſcribe rules to Gods wiſdome and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and raſhneſſe to ſay what is or is not in God, but as Chriſt hath revealed to us. <hi>Obedience is better then Sacrifice,</hi> and a ſimple belief of his words, better then our wiſeſt reaſonings againſt them. In <hi>pag.</hi> 298, 299. There is ſome difference about judging All men by the Goſpel. Indeed it ſhould be ſaid according to the Goſpel, the difference is grounded on the divers underſtanding of that phraſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16. They take it that this Truth, <hi>That all ſhall be Judged,</hi> is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Goſpel. We underſtand it alſo that Chriſt in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhall proceed according to the Goſpel. Not that we mean that they had heard not the Goſpel ſhall be judged for rejecting, or not believing what they heard not; but that they ſhall be judged onely for and by what they had given them, and they received or abuſed; but that Chriſt in judging, by, and for thoſe things, ſhall not go ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law of Creation, requiring them to have done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that that was given them in <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo according to the ſtrict rule of that firſt Obligation; but only as in rejecting Light and Truth given them, or accepting it, they have ſinned againſt,
<note place="margin">Rom. 1.18, 19, 20, 21.</note> or ſubmitted to God dealing with them, in and by the Mediator, the Word of God, by whoſe interpoſition of himſelf between God and them, their lives, liberties, mercies, and all the light they had ſince the Fall, was derived to them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. and ſo according to the Goſpel that relates Chriſt to have died for them, and to be Lord over all thereby. And that ſuch ſhall be his proceeding in Judgment, I am the rather perſwaded by that of Chriſt himſelf, in <hi>Matth</hi> 25.31.46. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where declaring the maner of his Judging All Nations; he tells us his Rewards, and puniſhments ſhall be given according to mens carriages of themſelves towards him in ſuch <hi>Mediums</hi> as he appeared in to them. He Judges men to life, as feeding and cloathing Him; to death, as not doing ſuch and ſuch things to him. Which he makes out to be an equal ſentence, though many ſhall reply, that they never ſee or knew him, as an object to be ſo or ſo acted toward by them. He mentions nothing there to be charged upon them as
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:117749:158"/>acted by <hi>Adam,</hi> or by them, but with reference to himſelf, which deſerves alſo ſome conſideration. Whereas in <hi>page</hi> 299. <q>
                        <hi>He tells us of</hi> Totus mundus ex to to mundo, <hi>a whole world out of the whole world;</hi>
                     </q> That he ſays without book, I mean, without Gods Book (ſpeaking of the world as it now is) having borrowed it from <hi>Proſper,</hi> or at higheſt from <hi>Auſtin.</hi> But we deſire not to prefer the Traditions and Documents of the Elders (though they might be in many things worthy men in their times) ſo highly as for them to juſtle out, or by them to Interpret Apoſtolical Doctrine: or by them to teach men their fear towards God, as was of old, and yet is too common a faſhion. Philoſophical Speculations, and the Elders Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, are uſed as pillars in Gods building, and many lean more upon them, then on the pillars of Gods own erecting, ſetting up their poſts and pillars by his, and ſlighting his for them, which we approve not.

                     </q> I eaſily grant it, and ſay, That the Apoſtle in <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.1, 4. in both places means, <hi>The faith delivered to the Saints,</hi> the Doctrine of Faith (as its no unuſual thing for him to do) which is the faith of Gods Elect, becauſe its that which they believe and hold forth to others, even to the world; and its the common faith, becauſe as its believed by them All, ſo its common to the world in point of right to be preached to them, and imbraced by them. Its that that contains good news for, and matter to be believed by All. But I have done with theſe his prevarications, with which he Anſwers <hi>T. Moors</hi> twentieth Chapter.

                        </label> But every one is bound to believe that Chriſt died for him; Therefore that Chriſt died for every one is true.</hi> An Argument, which for my part I own
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:117749:158"/>not in this form, as to All, and every man in the world, it being not preached to every one, that Chriſt died and is riſen. And I conceive that God requires not an explicit faith of propoſitions, that they have no Revelations of giving them ground to believe. But thus I own it, againſt their reſtrictive doctrine of tying Chriſts Death to the Elect onely, <hi>viz.</hi> That which of every one to whom the Goſpel is preached, is required as neceſſarily to be believed, that he might come to believe on Chriſt for ſalvation, that is, for every ſuch man true in it ſelf. But that Chriſt died for him in particular is required to be believed of every one to whom the Goſpel is preached as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for his believing in Chriſt for ſalvation. Therefore for every one to whom the Goſpel is preached: That is true.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Major</hi> leans upon this truth, That he that is required to do, or believe any thing, is therein required to do or believe all thoſe things that are neceſſary thereto, ſo as that without his doing or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving of them, he cannot do or believe thoſe other things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of him. The <hi>Minor</hi> we ſhall ſpeak to by and, when I have examined ſome things that he ſaith to the <hi>Minor</hi> of the Argument as mentioned by him. As</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <q>1. He ſaith "<hi>The believing that Chriſt dyed for a man, is the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving application of Chriſt to the ſoul, as held out in the promiſe.</hi>
                     </q> In which he miſtakes, for its onely a believing Chriſt to have ſo ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied for his ſin by his death, and to have ſuch fulneſs of Redemption in him for him, that he may hopefully go to him for remiſſion and ſalvation, there is good ground for him ſo to do, and its his ſin if he having opened ſuch a way for him to God and to ſalvation, he ſhould neglect it. But for the promiſes, they belong only to thoſe that through this belief of the grace of God,
<note place="margin">Gal. 3.22.</note> are drawn actually to truſt in Chriſt and love him; whence they are called the things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them that love God, and that truſt in him before the ſons of men; and for the confirmation of theſe men in the expectation of thoſe promiſes, the belief of Chriſts death for them is further uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. The Death of Chriſt was for ſinners, enemies, the ungodly, All men: but the promiſes of God in Chriſt, and ſo the Kingdome, are not the portion of any ſuch; but men are made heires of them through believing, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3 26.29. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.6, 7. ſo that here is a very foundamentall miſtake as to the queſtion in hand in this very ſaying.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He ſays <q>
                        <hi>To believe that Chriſt dyed for any, muſt be with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:117749:159"/>to the purpoſe of God the Father, and intention of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, and that that is it which with regard to any <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality is oppoſed by him.</hi>
                     </q> Which words I well apprehend not his meaning in. If he mean by Reference to Gods purpoſe and Chriſts inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; according as God purpoſed and Chriſt intended for them, or that God purpoſed and Chriſt intended that he ſhould dye for them; ſo we indeed mean by that phraſe. But if by it he means that God and Chriſt purpoſed in ſo doing eternally to ſave him; we ſo mean not that every man is bound to believe of Chriſts death for him: But that ſuch was Gods purpoſe and intention in Chriſts dying for him, that if he believe in him and in God through him, he ſhall undoubtedly be ſaved, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.16. And yet we put no If unto Gods purpoſe, which as ſecret concerns not our Faith (for as <hi>Luther</hi> well ſays, <hi>De Deo abſcondito nulla eſt fides, cognitio, &amp;c.</hi> But we put that If, into the way of mens participation of that ſalvation as God hath revealed it. Beſides to tell us how he oppoſes the Univerſality of Chriſts death, when he hath almoſt done oppoſing it, was not done (no though he had expreſt himſelf more clearly in it) very learnedly.</p>
                  <p>He ſays, <q>
                        <hi>The term Every one, muſt relate to All men in the like condition;</hi> which we grant it may.</q> And that like condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (in my ſtating it here) is not only as ſinners, unregenerate &amp;c. but alſo as the Goſpell coming to them and reporting good news to them in Chriſt, requires obedience of Faith of them, that they may be puld out of that ſinfull eſtate. Something he ſayes to the Major too, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>That that every one is bound to beleive, is neither in it ſelf true nor falſe, but good;</hi>
                     </q> which to me is a Paradox; good being not the Object of Faith but of appetite, deſire and love. Truth is the Object of Faith, chiefly of that that is divine and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by God; for men may believe, and in ſome caſes ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that, that in it ſelf holds forth evill to them: as men are bound to believe that they are ſinners, though its good that they ſhould believe ſo, yet its not a good thing that they are bound to believe therein, their being ſinners is not a good thing.</p>
                  <p>But now to the Minor, not only as in the firſt place mentioned by himſelf, but alſo in a manner as owned by me. He denies that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one thats called to by the Goſpel Preached, is bound to believe in particular that Chriſt dyed for him. To make good which deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; he ſayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <q>1 <hi>That no man is bound to believe that thats falſe: but that he
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:117749:159"/>dyed for every man is falſe, and he hath proved it ſo before.</hi>
                     </q> This is <hi>Petitio Principii,</hi> and contrary to the Scripture. He is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judge in his own cauſe, and any that reads my Anſwers may ſee his proofs have all failed.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <q>2. Then (he ſays) <hi>men ſhould be bound to believe immediately that that is not revealed; though Divine Revelation be the Object of all Faith.</hi>
                     </q> I deny this conſequence from the Minor either as laid down by me, or ſtated by him in the ſecond way. And whereas he ſays, <q>
                        <hi>That the Scriptures do not hold out any where that Chriſt died for this or that particular, as ſuch, but indefinitely as ſinners; ſpecified of times antecedently by Gods purpoſe, and conſequently by their owne purchaſed obedience.</hi>
                     </q> To the firſt of theſe paſſages, I ſay, that the Scriptures holding out an Univerſall propoſition, of truth, are, though not immediately, yet mediately the Object of Divine Faith to any one particular for himſelf thats included in the generall. As when its ſaid, All have ſinned; To believe thence that I have ſinned, is a Faith cloſing with and ſpringing from that that is revealed, though not immediately in the expreſſion, yet by undeniable inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and conſequence; And ſo in the caſe of the Reſurrection and Judgement, in cloſing with this divine Revelation, that all ſhall riſe and be judged, I neceſſarily upon the ſame divine Revelation believe that I ſhal riſe and be judged alſo; Yea, unleſſe I believe for my ſelf, I do not believe the Divine Revelation as concerning All. So is the caſe here, God having revealed that Chriſt dyed for every one, and all men &amp;c. In believing that Divine Truth, I believe that he hath done ſo for me; for that Divine Revelation includeth me as a man and one of the world. And if it be not ſo, I deny that any particular mans Faith in that particular can be proved to be grounded on the the word of God, or that he hath any right to believe on the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, or that there is a Mediator for him. To the latter paſſage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Scriptures, holding it forth only for ſinners indefinitely, often ſo and ſo ſpecified, I anſwer, 1. "Thats untrue, Its held out alſo for the world univerſally; 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.2. and for men generally, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4, 6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. Again, "2 He contradicts himſelf, for if Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſpecifie thoſe Sinners for whom Chriſt dyed, to be ſuch or ſuch, then it holds not out his Death for ſinners indefinitely. Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture holds forth nothing in any place, but as it agrees with the truth of other places, and indefinitely and boundedly, are contradictions when ſpoken of the ſame ſubject; Sinners unlimitedly (<gap reason="foreign">

I deny that the <hi>[Objectum totale]</hi> the full Object of the Death of Chriſt is any where ſpecified, either by the purpoſe of God to ſave them eternally, or the conſequent obedience found in them, which denyall we have mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged throughout this diſcourſe.</p>

                     <q>3. <hi>He ſaith, The purpoſe of God and his intention, is not propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the Object of the Faith of any,</hi>
                     </q> but only his commands, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and threatnings: the latter clauſe of which is not full enough; for neither are his commands properly the Object of Faith but of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, nor are thoſe things mentioned the onely object of Faith, ſure his Declarations may have a ſhare therein too. 2. His purpoſe and intention that he ſhould die for this or that man, is neceſſarily involved in the object of Faith propounding that he died for All men. But his purpoſe or intention of bringing this or that man ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely to eternal life, is not revealed as the object of Faith to any not united to Chriſt by Faith, and the inhabitation of the Spirit: But thats beyond our queſtion, not intended at all in the Argument, as either way produced; and ſo its impertinently here mentioned by Mr. <hi>Owen.</hi> In this alſo is anſwered his fourth Exception, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>That no command in Scripture to believe, is to be meaſured by Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and intention.</hi>
                     </q> His fifth onely anſwering to the <hi>Minor,</hi> as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned by me, I have nothing to ſay to it. But then he ſays, <q>
                        <hi>That the not owning the Argument as in the firſt way propounded, makes it uſeleſs as to the cauſe defended.</hi>
                     </q> To which I anſwer, That for Chriſts dying for every man in the world, we have more divine proofs then that can come to; but as altered into the ſecond form, it proves that Tenent untrue, that Chriſt died onely for Gods Elect, and them that ſhall for ever be ſaved, againſt which I own it. Beſides, this being granted, it will follow, That the Goſpel being propoſeable to All the world, and that obedience of Faith alſo requireable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon of All, there is the ſame truth in the matter of the Goſpel concerning Chriſts Death for them all alſo, it being otherwiſe not propoſeable, nor the obedience of Faith requirable of them. His anſwer to this, <q>
                        <hi>That its no ſafe diſputing of what ſhould or would be, if things were not as God hath appointed them,</hi> ſatisfies not.</q> For as 1. We need not ſuch diſputings, were men contented to be ſo far fools as to believe Doctrines as God propounds them. And 2 As ſuch ſuppoſitive Concluſions may be as ſtrong and undeniable upon ſuch ſuppoſed principles, as poſitive concluſions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> poſitive premiſes,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:117749:160"/>yea, and may illuſtrate poſitive truths too, at leſt they are as lawful for us to uſe, as for them that oppoſe us. So 3. This is not onely ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitive but poſitive, that the Goſpel is predicable to All, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the commiſſion runs to preach it to All, and I ſay its in this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive truth implied, that the truth therein declared (as true before mens faith) is true for All, for otherwiſe there would not be in it a predicability unto All, and ground for requiring Belief and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of All (we have opportunity, and that we might preach it unto) upon ſuch preaching it. But he excepts, <q>
                        <hi>That if the Goſpel were preached to All the world, and All in the world, yet this is all the will of God, that could in general be ſignified by it to them,</hi> viz. <hi>That he that believes ſhall be ſaved, and he that believes not ſhall be damned, and ſo that God hath concatinated theſe two together, Faith and Salvation.</hi>
                     </q> Which that its untrue, we have ſhewed before in <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. The Goſpel declares good will to All, That God would have all men ſaved and come to know the truth, <hi>&amp;c. ut ſupra.</hi> It argues mens wiſdom have too much blinded them from ſeeing into, or underſtanding the Goſpel, when they finde nothing in it for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and men in general, but that they that believe ſhall be ſaved, and can ſhew them no good reaſon that any of them have to believe in God, more then the Law can ſhew that ſays, he that doth thus and thus ſhall live. For ought that they can tell them God hath from Eternity hated them, and there is no way to ſalvation made for them. Surely thats not ſo much as what he further points to, <hi>That there is no name under heaven whereby they may be ſaved, but that of Jeſus,</hi> for that intimates that by that Name they may. But to this I have ſpoken ſufficiently before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>To what he ſays about the not believing Jeſus of Nazareth to be the Chriſt and their need of him, that its a ſoul-condemning infidelity of ſuch obſtinate refuſers to come in upon the Call of the Goſpel; and not a refuſing to believe that Chriſt died for every one of them in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular;</hi>
                     </q> I have anſwered alſo before; and ſay here further, That each of them are condemning. The laſt, becauſe there is not a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving of the Teſtimony of God, that he bears of his Son, and ſo not a receiving the love of the Truth, the love that the Truth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth, and ſo not a leaning upon his Mediation, nor an approaching to God thereby. For how ſhould he come to God by his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that refuſeth to believe that he died for him in particular, and ſo that his Mediation for him? <q>
                        <hi>The</hi> Jews (ſayes he) <hi>were charged
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:117749:161"/>with infidelity for not believing Chriſt to be their Meſſiah.</hi>
                     </q> And truly by Mr. <hi>Owens</hi> Doctrine he was not ſo. For how was he for them, if he was a Mediator for none but the Elect, ſeeing they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in unbelief and rebellion? Sure mens not believing their need of a Mediator, or that Jeſus is He, proves not that they are not chargeable with not believing Chriſt to have died for them, no more then others not believing themſelves to be ſinners, proves that they are not chargeable with not believing in Chriſt. The object of Faith, I trow, is not to be meaſured by mens acts of Faith, but their acts ought to come up to that thats in the object.</p>
                  <p>But beyond all theſe, he hath ſomewhat more to the <hi>Minor, viz.</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>That they to whom the Gospel is preached, are bound to believe with that faith which is required to juſtification onely.</hi>
                     </q> I will not ſtand upon that word <hi>onely,</hi> I am content that he grants, They are bound to believe with that Faith; but then he aſſumes, <q>
                        <hi>That that is not a full perſwaſion that Chriſt died for any one in particular.</hi>
                     </q> Here I except againſt the word <hi>full perſwaſion,</hi> as being a <hi>Quartus terminus,</hi> which is not fit for a Diſputant to put into a Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſm. Nor is it to the purpoſe, that it is not juſtifying Faith; its enough to this buſineſs if it be neceſſary to a juſtifying faith (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Revelation of the Goſpel ſince his Aſcenſion) to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and be perſwaded that Chriſt died for him in particular, though his perſwaſion be not full;
<note place="margin">Rom. 3.25</note> and that I ſay is neceſſary. For to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to juſtification, is to believe on God through Chriſt, or in the bloud of Chriſt, and that is from that that Chriſt as Mediator hath done and is further authorized to doe, to be perſwaded to reſt on God for ſalvation by him. Which I deny that any man can rightly come to, except he believe that that which God hath done in Chriſt, and that which Chriſt hath done as Mediator between God and man, was done alſo for him. I can Divinely gather no boldneſs from the bloud or ſufferings of Chriſt to approach the Holies, and look to God to ſave me, further then by a Divine Faith that leans upon Gods teſtimony I am perſwaded that thoſe ſufferings of Chriſt concerned me, and were for me. But let us ſee how <hi>M.O.</hi> goes on in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that is thus; He ſays, <q>
                        <hi>there is an order naturall in it ſelf, and eſtabliſhed by Gods appointment in the things that are to be believed, ſo that till ſome of them are believed, the reſt are not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. As a man is not commanded (nor can be reaſonably) to get to the top of the Ladder, by skipping all the lower rounds.</hi>
                     </q> But what
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:117749:161"/>makes this to prove the buſineſs in hand. 1. This ſhews that a mau cannot come to believe with a juſtifying Faith, (the thing <hi>ex con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſo</hi> required of them to whom the Goſpel is preached) except he orderly believe thoſe things that lead unto it, of which I contend, That this is one, to believe that God hath provided him Chriſt to be his Mediator, and that he hath died for him, and ſo that he hath good ground to believe in him, and rely on God through him; and ſo it makes for what I ſay; but it proves not that every ſtep in that order are not required of every one to whom the Goſpel is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that ſo he may come to that that is principally required, <hi>viz.</hi> To juſtifying Faith. His compariſon is not worth a Ruſh to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. For though I would not rationally bid a man climb up into a chamber by a ladder, and skip all the rounds ſave the higheſt, yet I may rationally bid him climb up to it, and go by all the rounds, and ſo by the higheſt, and I trow, his not going up one ſtep will not excuſe him for not going all, even up the higheſt too. He that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands me to believe with a juſtifying faith, ſurely commands me therein to go by every ſtep that tends to it, and to believe all thats abſolutely requiſite for believing with that faith. 2. He here ſpeaks againſt his main Conceſſion, <hi>viz.</hi> That men that hear the Goſpel are bound to believe with a juſtifying faith. For here he ſays in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, That thats not required till they have firſt believed the truths that lead to it, and ſo Gods Commands ſhall be bounded by mans obedience. If any man to whom the Goſpel is preached, ſhall deny to believe that there is ſuch a one as Chriſt, that man is not required of God to believe in Chriſt, for its irrational to require him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, till he hath firſt obeyed him in believing the other. I ſuppoſe any man that underſtands reaſon, will rather think that Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> had not the exerciſe of reaſon about him when he here talked of irrationality: the firſt proof of his Argument contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting his Argument. For the Argument ſaith, That they to whom the Goſpel is preached are bound to believe with a juſtifying faith, and the proof ſays it is irrational that they ſhould be required to that, till they believe that there is an object of faith To ſay nothing that the believing Chriſt to have died for a man, is not the higheſt ſtep to that faith, as he ſuppoſeth. But after this he ſets down his order, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <q>1. <hi>That men are to repent and believe the Goſpel to be the Word of God, to contain his Will, and that Jeſus Chriſt therein revealed is the power and wiſdom of God to ſalvation.</hi> 2. <hi>That there is an inſeparable
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:117749:162"/>connexion between faith and ſalvation.</hi> 3. <hi>That there be a conviction by the ſpirit of a neceſſity of a Redeemer to their ſouls in particular, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they become weary, heavy laden, and burdened.</hi> 4. <hi>A ſerious full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbency, and reſting the ſoul upon Chriſt in the promiſe of the Goſpel, as an Alſufficient Saviour, able to deliver and ſave to the utmoſt them that come to God by him, Ready, able, and willing, through the preciouſneſs of his blood, and ſufficiency of his ranſom, to ſave every ſoul that ſhall freely give up themſelves to him for that end amongſt whom he is reſolved to be one. Now</hi> (ſays he) <hi>in doing all this there is none called on by the Goſpel, once to inquire after the purpoſe and intention of God concerning the particular object of the death of Chriſt, every one being fully aſſured that his Death ſhall be profitable to them that believe in him, and obey him: but after all this, and not before, it lies upon a believer to aſſure his ſoul of the good will, and eternal love of God to him, to ſend his Son to dye for him in particular.</hi>
                     </q> I might here return him his own words with admiration, Oh what a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous courſe is this, and how differing from the right way of the Goſpel! 1. I would know what is that Goſpel that men in the firſt place are to believe to be true: Is it onely that Jeſus Chriſt is the power and wiſdom of God to ſalvation, and the connexion of faith and ſalvation? That we have ſhewed before to be untrue. The Word of God it ſelf tells us, that the Goſpel uſed to tell men of Chriſts being ſent of God, to turn them in particular from their ſins, and to lay down that as the ground of Repentance, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving on him,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2, 4.6. And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtleſays ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, that that wâs the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, or Goſpel that God ordained and ſent him to preach. ver. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 3.26. <hi>And that God would have all to be ſaved, and come to the knowledge of the truth, for there is one God, and one Mediator between God and man, the Man Chriſt Jeſus, who gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a ranſom for All;</hi> and can a man believe that to be true, and not believe that he gave himſelf a ranſon for him? Is he no body? So that what he ſays in this firſt ſtep, overthrows him. But 2. See the prepoſterouſneſs of theſe men, that that the Apoſtle writ about the High-Prieſthood of Chriſt to the believers as peculiarly uſeful for them, to lead them up to perfection in their faith and confidence, <hi>viz.</hi> [That Chriſt hath the office of an unchangeable Prieſthood, &amp; is able to ſave to the utmoſt all that come to God by him, becauſe he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them] that is here produced as the ground to draw in unbelievers, though the interceſſion there mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned is not affirmed there for any, as, &amp; while yet unbelievers: and on the other hand, that which the Apoſtle tells us, was the Teſtimony,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:117749:162"/>whereof God had made him a Miniſter &amp; an Apoſtle to preach to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> that were ignorant of God (as that before repeated) that is not to be preached as true for any ones particular, and as ſo to be believed by him till they are made believers. Who would think that wiſe men ſhould go ſo prepoſterous a way? but that its the judgement of God for their leaning to their own wiſdom, and no more then is fore-propheſied, that God will deſtroy the wiſdom of the wiſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. He impertinently mixes the object of faith with the operations of that object attended to and believed, as conviction by the Spirit of their need of a Redeemer, and recumbency in him with the truths of God that lead to that convincement, and reliance on him. The Argument is about the object of faith needful to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by all that hear the Goſpel, that they may believe to juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And he tells us of an order in the operations of God upon mens ſpirits, before they believe as they ſhould do. And yet he minds not that the convincement of the great ſin of unbelief is not kindly effected, till men ſee they have ground of believing, and yet believe not; till when the heart rather thinks it is ſin and preſumption to believe. But when it ſees that Chriſt hath done ſo much for it, then it muſt needs be convinced that it ſins greatly, in not betruſting it ſelf wholly to him. 4. He confounds the object of faith about the Mediation of Chriſt, and the object of his Death, with the ſecret Purpoſe and Counſel of God about our particular right to, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of eternal ſalvation. 5. He talks of rolling the ſoul upon Chriſt in a Promiſe, whenas he cannot prove that any can have him in a Promiſe to be rolled on, further then he is ſuppoſed firſt to have dyed for him, the Promiſes being ſealed in his blood, and the way of cloſing with them is believing in his blood; which how ſhould men do wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>le its wholly doubtful to them, whether they have any thing to do with his blood or nor? Indeed. 6. He ſuppoſes that a ſoul is brought to believe in God, and to truſt in his mercie through Chriſt, before it know of any love in God toward it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he uſes to draw with the cords of love, and teſtimonies of his goodneſs. Its goodneſs ſeen in him leads us to repentance; Its not only a letting ſinners ſee a need of a Saviour, &amp; that there is one able to ſave them that go to God by him, that will ſuffice to draw in a man that yet cannot ſee him as a way for him to go to God by (as he is not for any otherwiſe then he hath died for them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19, 20.) to rowl himſelf upon God for ſalvation. Never yet could any
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:117749:163"/>ſinner that indeed was convinced to be ſo, and to be under wrath, and that ſaw Gods Juſtice and Anger againſt him, hope in, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect help from God by Chriſt, not being firſt perſwaded that Chriſt had done ſo much for him, that he might have ſalvation through him. Many men may delude themſelves, and take their own ſelf-actings for acts of Grace, as the Phariſee did, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.10, 11. and from their endeavors, and ſelf reformations, ſeem to commit themſelves to God, and conclude themſelves to be believers, that yet never knew what it is rightly to believe. The true Goſpel-believers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve through Grace,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.1.</note> as they <hi>Acts</hi> 18.27. That is by the grace and goodwill of God declared to them in the Goſpel. The grace of God appearing to them, teaches them to live godlily, and ſaves them from their former diſobedient condition. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12. and 3.4, 5. They do no, <hi>per</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>(as the Phariſee) argue Gods grace towards them by their frames towards him, that God loved them firſt, becauſe they (as they conceive) love him, but on the contrary, they therefore love him becauſe he firſt loved them, and ſent his Son for them. Believing Gods Teſtimony of what Chriſt hath done for them, they are helped through the power of God to believe in him, and caſt themſelves upon God for further ſaving. So the Apoſtles were led, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. and not from believing on him, to argue that Chriſt died for them. So that this notwithſtanding that Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> hath ſaid, I yet ſtand to my former Argument, and ſhall not need to put it into the following frame in his Book, into which he puts it.</p>

                     </q> I anſwer, It's corruption and unbelief, ſetting up it ſelf againſt the truth of Chriſt in the Goſpell, that makes men hold forth the Particularity of Chriſts Death as being undergone only for the Elect, and the Doctrine it ſelf gives occaſions and cauſes of ſcruple to men, in this, that men ſeeing their ſinfulneſs, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon God, but according to what this doctrine preſents of him to them, they are wholly uncertain whether the Mediator was ſent for them or not, and ſo whether God be an object of faith fit for them. 2. <q>He tels us that obiection ſuppoſeth, <hi>That a man is bound to believe, that Jeſus Chriſt dyed by the appointment of God for him in particular, before he believe in Chriſt Jeſus; and that men that are of that perſwaſion of the reſtraint of the Death of Chriſt to the Elect, may ſcruple whether they ought to believe or not,</hi> which he ſays, <hi>is to involve our ſelves into a plain contradiction; for according to Scripture, for a man to be perſwaded, that Chriſt dyed for him in particular, is the higheſt improvement of faith, including a ſenſe of the ſpirituall love of God ſhed abroad into our hearts; the top of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles conſolation,</hi> Rom. 8.34. <hi>and the bottome of his joyfull aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> Gal. 2.20. <hi>ſo that we require that a man do believe before he do believe and</hi> (ſuppoſe) <hi>that he cannot believe, and ſhall exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fear whether he ought to do ſo, except he believe before he believe.</hi>
                     </q> To this I anſwer, That for a man to be perſwaded that Chriſt dyed for him, is no where made the higheſt improvement of faith: but only that faith by the belief of this hath been improved (and ſo may be) to higheſt pitches: the ſoul that perceives, ſee and mindes the love of God, therethrough commended, ſo as to be drawn to God thereby, abiding therein may grow up to great aſſurance therein; and find matter of exceeding great nouriſhment unto eternall life: But it follows not, that becauſe from that believers have ſprung up to ſuch aſſurance of eternall life, as in the greateſt tryals and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to truſt in him for it, and make their boaſt of God (which is the higheſt improvement of faith) That the bare believing that Chriſt dyed for them, is the faith of full aſſurance. Some of the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites from beholding the great power and goodneſs of God to them, in delivering them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and bringing them over the red Sea, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were led to follow God with a full heart, and to be ſilled with a full perſwaſion that they ſhould be brought into <hi>Canaan</hi> and poſſeſs it; but it followed not thence, that the belief or
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:117749:164"/>knowledge that God ſo delivered them, was the faith of full aſſurance of entering into <hi>Canaan,</hi> by all that knew that they were thence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered. So <hi>Paul</hi> was lead with confidence to truſt in God for future deliverance, by this, that he had delivered him; and yet its not ever true, that he that believes that God delivered him from one dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, is confident he will from another; much leſs That that belief in all that ſo believe (yea or in any) is the confidence that he will deliver from another. 2. Whereas he askes if it include not a ſenſe of the ſpirituall love of Chriſt; I anſwer, That where the Death and Reſurrection of Chriſt are opened to the heart by the Holy Ghoſt, there the love of God is ſhed abroad into the heart alſo; but not wherever this propoſition is believed, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt dyed for me: many a man believes that, and yet ſeeth not into the glory of it, nor the depth of goodneſs held forth in it, and ſo hath not the love of God therethrough ſhed into his heart; yet the minding God in this, is the way to meet with the holy Ghoſts diſplaying that love. Many Iſraelites believed that God brought them out of Egypt,
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.9.</note> that had not ſuch a view of his power and love therein (or at leaſt, like them that forget that they were purged from their old ſins, forgat what they had ſeen) as to be lead to confidence in God for the future by it. 3. Whereas he ſays, "<hi>By this a man muſt believe before he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve;</hi> What ſtrange thing is that with reference to diverſe acts of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving? did not he himſelf ſay, that we muſt have a faith of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and recumbence in Chriſt, and before that too believe many truths of the Goſpell before we can believe that Chriſt dyed for us? ſo that there is believing before believing, and believing before be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving again, and yet he counts that abſurd in us, when we ſay only, we muſt believe the word of God to be true, before we can by it be led to believe in God; we muſt believe Gods goodwill to us-ward, and a <hi>medium</hi> provided for us by whom to go to God, before we can be perſwaded to go to him by faith, whom otherwiſe we look upon as angry and dreadfull, ready to conſume us. We cannot put our confidence in his blood, and there through riſe up to aſſurance of eternall life, except we firſt be perſwaded that he ſhed his blood for us; So long as we doubt whether he be a Mediator for us or no, and whether he hath given himſelf to ranſome us from death, we ſhall doubt whether God will accept us or no, or whether he hare us from eternity or not, and whether we have any thing to do to take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement from the blood of Chriſt to approach him, becauſe
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:117749:165"/>we know not we have any right unto it. Nor can Maſter <hi>Owen,</hi> nor all the world beſide to help him, make it appear to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, but that the ſoul will queſtion whether it may expect ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God, or betruſt it ſelf with God, ſo long as it knows not but he hates it, and Chriſt hath never done any thing with him for it.</p>

                     </q> The conſequence of this, is, that many things were ſpoken unneceſſarily by the Apoſtles,

                     </note> which reaches to All ſinners) ought to believe in Chriſt? What have ſinners, if not Elect, to do with Chriſt? beſides, he had ſaid before, they muſt be ſinners ſo and ſo convinced and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, before they are to be called upon to believe in Chriſt. And I fear he will upon ſecond thoughts ſay, that thoſe Scriptures hold forth, that ſinners, not as ſuch, but as ſo qualified with thirſting after Chriſt and being weary, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are there required to believe; but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a ſoul is hereby put upon doubting, whether it be Elected, or ſo convinced and thirſty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as is required, and ſo whether God be not an enemy to it from eternity, and ſo whether it hath cauſe of truſting in him. 2. The command of God, <hi>John</hi> 3.23. That ſhews it to be its duty, if it could be proved to extend to it, for that ſays, That we believe in his name, and a ſoul may more juſtly doubt whether that <hi>We</hi> reach to it, ſeeing they that deny the extent of Chriſts Death and teach it to doubt of it, uſe ſuch applicatives as <hi>We</hi> to oppoſe an Univerſality, and to ſignify but the Elect and Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This therefore yet leaves the ſoul to doubt whether it may hope in him for ſalvation, eſpecially being told that theſe things God ſends to
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:117749:165"/>men indefinitely, that the Elect onely might be brought to him; he hath no goodwill to any other, and that its Elect it knows not, commands to believe while men are taught to doubt whether the object to be believed in (as ſuch) pertains to them, can give no more ſecurity from doubting, then the building with one hand and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down with another ſecures the building from falling.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. "<hi>The threats againſt unbelief.</hi> That indeed doth as much as the threat for not keeping the Law, fils the ſoul with terror on every ſide, while it hears that God commands more to believe then have cauſe ſo to do, and threatens them for not believing, and yet gives them nothing to induce them to it; no evidence of his goodwill to them to draw them to believe: this may fill them with hard thoughts of God, repreſenting him to them like one that bids another eat, or elſe he will kill him, but yet gives him no meat to feed on, no evidence of his goodneſs that may induce him to hope and truſt in him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. "<hi>The alſufficiency of the blood of Chriſt to ſave all believers.</hi> This may make the ſoul ſay; O how happy are they that do believe, and that have his blood to drink, for its able to ſave them, but as for me I know not whether it belong to me or not, or whether one drop of it was ſhed for me, and ſo how I can lean upon it: I hear its not ſufficient to ſave any that it was not ſhed for, not for want of inward worth in it, but becauſe its not for them, and I may be one of them for ought I know.</p>

                     </q> Theſe two are of the ſame nature with the former; only the ſoul hath this to except. Its not every believer, for many fall away in time of temptation, having no root in them, as my faith cannot have if I know not that Chriſt dyed for me, and ſo grow not upon Gods love therein evidenced to me. The ſoul cannot ſo believe as to love God (and ſo but with a dead faith) unleſs it believe his love firſt. It may ſee all its endeavors to believe, and to reſt on God, to be but fleſhly ſtrivings out of ſelf principles, and at the beſt it argues Gods love but from its own believing, which it may juſtly queſtion, the heart being deceitfull, and he a fool that truſts for it for evidencing his condition. This is but a promiſe and an aſſurance of thriving to all that eat duely of a meat, which it knows not whether it may or can duely eat or not; for to eat the fleſh, and drink the blood of Chriſt, and ſo to believe on them; is
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:117749:166"/>when the ſoul beholding the love of God and Chriſt in his Death and ſacrifice commended to it, doth gather boldneſs and incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to love and caſt it ſelf upon God, and ſo grows up into the full aſſurance of peculiar love to him, even to eternall life; without the knowledge of love to the ſoul firſt, it can but at higheſt come to this: It may be I am one that God loves, and perhaps not; well, I will leave thinking about it, and tyring my ſelf with thoughts (if I can) and let it alone, I muſt ſubmit when all is done to be diſpoſed to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or Hell by him; which indeed is a condition moſt ſit and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the Goſpell to be preached to, but is far from faith in God which works by Love, and is juſtifying. Theſe things, The call to believe, the command, threatning, promiſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are good evidences that the ranſome is given and accepted for All, and there is good proviſion in Chriſt for them (God never uſing to call men to any ordinance that he appointed not for them) and coming with this they may incourage thee to believe on, and love him that gave his Son for thee to believe on. And this (implyed by them) is that declaration, that good tidings to ſinners, that indeed draws them into believe through the ſpirits working in them, or elſe if they turn their backs upon it, renders them throughly guilty; when they ſhall ſay in their hearts, O, what did God for me! and what cauſe had I to believe, and to have ſtayed upon him, but I refuſed it! As the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> were indeed ſinners, for not believing when God had done ſo much for them to ingage them to it. His conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion then under this head is falſe, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>That thoſe are enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all doubts, and fears,</hi>
                     </q> much leſs (which I would rather urge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it) are they ſufficient to incourage and imbolden the heart and frame it to believe; but more eſpecially is that falſe that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in him <hi>viz.</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>That thoſe are All that the Scripture holds out to that purpoſe.</hi>
                     </q> It holds out others, as we have noted from <hi>Acts</hi> 3.26. &amp; 13 37. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4, 5, 6. but of this he can take no notice, they are nothing for his purpoſe. I could give him back here ſome of his own expreſſions, as that in <hi>pag.</hi> 283. <q>
                        <hi>That if pride and error had not taken too much poſſeſſion of mens minds, they could not ſo far deny what they reade in plain texts of Scripture</hi> (as if they had never ſeen them) <hi>to maintain their corrupt and falſe opinions.</hi>
                     </q> But he anſwers further.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <q>
                        <hi>That that perſwaſion which aſſerts the certainty of the Death of Chriſt to All believers, and,</hi> 2. <hi>That affirms the command of God,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:117749:166"/>and call of Chriſt to be infallibly declarative of that duty which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of the perſon commanded and called, which if it be performed will be aſſuredly acceptable to God.</hi> 3. <hi>That holds out purchaſed, free grace, to all diſtreſſed, burthened conſciences whatſoever,</hi> and 4. <hi>Diſcovers a fountain of blood alſufficient to purge all the ſin of every man in the World that will uſe the appointed means for coming unto it; that doctrine cannot poſſibly be the canſe of any doubt or ſcruple in the hearts of convinced burthened ſinners, whether they ought to believe or no.</hi>
                     </q> I anſwer, that this is in a manner the ſame with the former, and there anſwered. I will adde this touching the ſecond particular, that its ambiguous, whether by the perſon called, he mean, by man in the preaching of the Goſpell, or by God effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, for many are of that mind that God cals not nor holds forth Goſpell to all that the Miniſters declare it to, but only to the Elect; &amp; if he be of that mind too, its not ſo undoubtedly true to the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er as he would make it, that God requires what the Miniſter doth, becauſe they may be divided; the command and call may be intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only to ſome, that the hearer knows not whether he be one of or not, though the Preacher out of ignorance direct it to all; and this may beget much doubting in the hearer whether its Gods voice to or him no. Again he ſuppoſeth more in this Doctrine he pleads for in two laſt particulars, then is in it; as that it holds forth purchaſed free grace to all diſtreſſed burthened conſciences; there are many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Heathen have their conſciences accuſing them, yea &amp; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times like furies burthening them; there are many that profeſs Chriſt, conſcious of heinous ſins, and are ready to deſpaire, and make away themſelves for them; there are many burthened that they can no more walk up to the righteouſneſs, and labor to ſtabliſh righteouſneſs to themſelves, and cannot be ſetled. Will Maſter <hi>Owen</hi> ſay that their doctrine holds forth purchaſed free grace to all theſe? that I deny, for it ſays he purchaſed free grace only for the Elect: and that all ſuch are Elected, I ſuppoſe he will be put to it to prove; ſeeing many ſuch go on in their ſins notwithſtanding their burthens, and many ſeek to put them off, and ſometimes do ſtifle them by worldly imployments and vanities, and many actually deſpair, and make away themſelves. If he ſay he means not ſuch, the matter is where it was, the diſtreſſed conſcience may yet doubt (and is apt ſo to do) whether it may not be one of thoſe in the iſſue. As for that in the fourth, that there is an alſufficiency in the blood of Chriſt for all
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:117749:167"/>that will uſe the appointed means, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I will not ſtand to tell him (though I might) that his ſpeech here is like one of them that in us he uſes to tax with-holding Free-will, which ſeeing he declaims againſt, I hope he will be ſo charitable as to allow us the like liberty of ſpeaking, without faſtening upon us that <hi>Odium.</hi> But I ſay, (to paſs that) I fear he will be put to it again to prove this alſo by his doctrine, ſeeing many are willing to run to Ordinances, and do any thing to have eaſe, and comfort, and yet afterward forget that they were purged from their old ſins, and having eſcaped the pollutions of the world, and walked in the means appointed for a while, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward imbrace the preſent world, and fall off again, which their doctrine intimates, they muſt do, and will, if not elected, or elſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver meet with any thing of God to purpoſe, though they ſhould continue attending the means to the laſt gaſp. I fear he will not ſay Chriſt had any Free grace for theſe; and yet all weary, heavy laden ſinners, one and other Chriſt calls to him, yea, and the fools and ſcorners too, the wicked, unrighteous, and who not? to liſten to his Doctrine for ſalvation. So that theſe are but fair flouriſhes, that being looked into, wind up onely in this, Though ye be never ſo much troubled and weary, and never ſo diligent now in the uſe of means, yet foraſmuch as your Election is unknown to us, we cannot ſay that there is any thing purchaſed by Chriſt for you, or that the blood of Chriſt is ſufficient to purge you, becauſe we yet know not whether it was ſhed for you; whatever inward worth it hath in it, yet it being ſhed onely for the Elect, he may not be able to ſave you by it, nor unleſs ye be elected will all your uſe of means profit you, if you ſhould continue in them. And ſo all depends yet (even its future uſe of means too) upon that hidden purpoſe; and till that be known, whether there be any cauſe for it to rely on Chriſt, and love him, and God in him, he knoweth not; ſo that all theſe anſwers avail him nothing; therefore he doth well to leave his anſwering, and fall to querying, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>What that is, that according to our perſwaſion, men are bound to believe when they firſt know that Chriſt died for them?</hi>
                     </q> I anſwer, They are to believe, that Chriſt is their lawful Lord, and able to ſave them, and that they ought to live to him, alſo that God is good and loving to them (which is not a thing known before-hand, (as he ſays) but in and through the knowing Chriſt to have died for them, as the Cauſe, though it be before the Effect, yet <hi>in ordins
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:117749:167"/>cognoſcendi,</hi> it may be through, and in order of nature after the knowledg of the effect) which alſo the Spirit will there through be now glorifying, and preſenting to the ſoul, (they attending the doctrine of Chriſt, and following him therein) till it raiſe them up to full aſſurance, as it did the Apoſtles Yea, upon the knowing of the death of Chriſt for them, its to believe that God delights not in their death, but is ready, in and through Chriſt to ſave them; and will do it, they (as they herein ſee good ground, and as alſo they are by the Goſpel that declares it obliged to do) waiting on him, and truſting in him. Now whereas he ſays, <q>
                        <hi>That they cannot, there being no fruits of his Death but what are common to All, which may be Damnation as well as Salvation.</hi>
                     </q> Thats very untrue. 1. Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is not the fruit of his Death, but of mens abuſing the mercies they have by his Death, and their refuſing to liſten to him, and look to him for ſalvation. 2. The fruits of his Death in them, and to them that come to him, are waſhing, purging, ſanctifying, giving in remiſſion, peace, joy, ſpirit, and life everlaſting. So that, that is either an ignorant miſtake, or a wilful ſlander; and yet, as its true, that ſome men may ſo abuſe the Doctrine of Chriſts Death for them, or ſo diſſerve him, that his Death for them may be an aggravation of their puniſhment and miſery, ſo in that ſenſe. As the fruit of Gods Preſence with the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that led them out of <hi>Egypt</hi> into the Wilderneſs, was to them that believed (as they all had reaſon to have done) protection, and guidance into <hi>Canaan,</hi> and poſſeſſing them thereof; but to others that (cauſleſly) rebelled (through their own folly) deſtruction: So is Chriſt, and the Goſpel of Chriſt, a Savour of life to life in them that receive, but of death to death in them that reject him. So that, as he anſwered impertinently, and inconcludently for himſelf before, ſo he anſwers untruly, and irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally here for us. But I leave that alſo.</p>
                  <p>From this he comes to tell us, <q>
                        <hi>That there are two things that both perſwaſions pretend to, the exaltation of Gods free Grace, and the Merit of Chriſt.</hi>
                     </q> To the firſt of theſe he plays the Rhetorician, more then either Logician, or Divine. <q>
                        <hi>He asks what that free grace is.</hi>
                     </q> And I anſwer, This, That God hath given his Son to die for All, and through him tenders ſalvation freely in the Goſpel to All, Whoever will, let him come, he is ready to receive him, reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting or reprobating none from it to deſtruction, but for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting his Truth and goodneſs made known to them. His <hi>Queries,</hi>

                     </q> (If by Redemption in Chriſts blood, he means the actuall ſetting their ſpirits at liberty from ſin and corruption, and from the power of Satans deluſions, to worſhip and live to God (effected by the ſprinkling of his blood upon them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.13, 14) as is there intended, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9.) miſs the cuſhion. Though Free Grace ſtandeth in all theſe things, which we maintain as well as they, yet the extent of it, we ſay not ſtandeth in them, but in giving his Elect (one in whom his Election and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes all are) to the death for All, and ſetting him up as a <hi>medium,</hi> to whom coming, any of them may (and in coming ſhall) finde Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, Sanctification, Redemption, and what ever follows. which the Goſpel holds forth freely to All, as ready in him for them, and to be diſpenſed by him to them upon believing, which ſo held forth is the <hi>medium</hi> alſo of his effectual calling.

                     </q> I anſwer, That it is not the firſt, the authority of Gods Word acquits us, which we dare not for all the Sophiſms he hath brought againſt it, renounce, to cleave to that <hi>onely Elect,</hi> which he, and the <hi>Elders</hi> traditions have created, and to which they bow the knew of their faith, more then to Gods Word. And if no device of our own, then no new name. For that Idol of Freewill, which we no more adore, if ſo much as they, who ſubſtracting the declaration of Gods good Will to men as pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them (the <hi>medium</hi> appointed by him for his power to work in to uninthral men, and impower them to believe) do yet call upon men to believe and get Chriſt, as if they had power of themſelves to get him, and to believe on him, thundring damnation upon them that believe not, though they ſay God never gave any power to them, ſetting men upon an indeavouring by their own power, and approving their ſuch indeavors, as the products of Gods Grace (as the Phariſee did <hi>Luke</hi> 18.10, 11.) though they have not declared that to them, as pertaining to them. We attribute no more to Will then the Scripture affords. Its meerly with our expreſſions ſuitable to the Scriptures that they quarrel at.

And we think it leſs derogation to his grace, and more agreeable to the Scriptures, to ſay, that God in his workings with men, gives them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and power to make uſe of, and liſten to the means of light and life afforded them, and that when he in thoſe means works and convinces, moves at and ſtrives with their hearts, he gives them (in thoſe ſtrivings and convincements) power and liberty, to ſee and minde, and acknowledge what they could not do before, and in ſuch acknowledgement yet to attend the means and grope further after him, if perhaps he may (when he hath unraveled them of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) inable them to believe; and that they wink with the eye, refuſe and reject the means put within their reach and ſuited to their infirmity; or if they do attend them, yet that when they meet with reproof and convincement, they refuſe to ſee or take notice of what God ſhews them, and to hear the inward voices of ſpirit that ſpeak to them, rebell againſt the light, and pull away the ſhoulder, quenching, ſmothering, and impriſoning the operations of Gods Spirit and truth, and that for theſe things he juſtly rejects them: then to ſay that God doth nothing for men, gives no power to them, requires all that they had in <hi>Adam</hi> (for which the Scripture affords them not one title of proof) cals upon them to do things to which he gives no power or means, and yet condemns them for ever not for doing them, and yet ſuch are M. <hi>Owens</hi> expreſſions: as when he ſays, <q>
                        <hi>We make God to propound life upon ſuch a condition as he knows they cannot perform without him, and yet in it, he will do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for them, he will not give them it.</hi>
                     </q> Which is a great miſtake for want of believing the truth of God recorded: for when he bids men liſten to him, and their ſouls ſhall life, if ſome refuſe to liſten, and others when convincements come tending to the ſaving them out of their ſinfull condition, willingly turn from them and will not abide them, nor fall down under them, and ſo not liſten to his inward convictions of them, but run away from him that would not
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:117749:169"/>be wanting in their further liſtening to him to quicken them up to believe, and ſo to gather them; ſhall we ſlander God, and ſay now, becauſe theſe never come to that believing, that he would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon them that condition? he knows that they cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve of themſelves, and he will give them no faith. Becauſe they cannot believe of themſelves, followes it therefore that they receive no power from him by which they might attend upon the means in which he uſes to beget faith, and give it to men? ſhall he be ſaid to deny them faith, when they refuſe to liſten to him that would ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them to the faith? ſays not he himſelf that he would have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> children, and they would not? was not this ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering them, a bringing them by faith into himſelf (as the Chickens under the Hens wings) for ſafety? was not their refuſall in not ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly attending to him, but ſhutting their ears againſt his ſayings? ſhall we ſay he refuſed to give that that he chides them for refuſing to receive? Come forth the beſt of you all, and prove that God hath not given you in his workings upon you, power to have ſought him and attended to him better then ye have done, and then I will ſay your reaſoning for the wicked is good, that he ſet ſalvation before them upon a condition that they could not have without his gift, and yet he refuſed to give it them, otherwiſe his after-compariſon <q>[in which he ſays, <hi>We make God like a man tendring a blind man a thouſand pounds, if he will open his eyes which he cannot</hi>]</q> is but an inept one, for God complains of men for ſhutting their eyes, and otherwhere bids them but look with their blind eye-holes, that they might ſee his word that he ſends giving light to them that attend upon it, being never ſo blind.

And yet I am perſwaded, many of them ſhall riſe up in judgement with their leſſe, againſt many amongſt us that have more, he lets them know and perceive more then they acknowledg, and gives them

                  <p>That our Doctrine everts the whole Covenant of diſtinguiſhing grace, is another untruth; we hold and prove that the Death of Chriſt ſeals and ratifies it, and we think the free grace of God freely made it, and powerfully puls men into it as he pleaſes; holding it forth to men largely, and ready to enter into it any that will hear him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.2, 3, 4 Whereas he askes, <q>

                  <p>"<hi>He bids men</hi> (3.)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(3)"/> 
                     <hi>conſider by their own experience.</hi> But who ſpeaks he to here, and whoſe experience will he take in this matter? Them of his own minde? they believe it not, and therefore cannot experiment its good. If them that believe it, they will many of them ſay, That they have met with great conſolation by it, and have been brought through it to believe, and walk both holily and hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with God. Yea, ſome in their agonies upon death-bed have met with great comfort in it, and dyed trinmphantly. But of theſe things Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> is no competent Judge, he being no believer of it. Verily they have been carried above all other, thoſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations that reaſon ſuggeſts (from others periſhing Chriſts Death notwithſtanding) knowing that what ever befalls others its for their folly and unbelief,
<note place="margin">Heb. 4.2. 1 Cor. 10.1, 2, 3, 4.5.11.</note> of which they ſee this Doctrine gave no cauſe, nor gives any (but for faith) to them. No more then the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods like dealing with our fathers in giving to them the Goſpel, and like Goſpel-Ordinances, in a ſort, as to us, and yet their periſhing for their unbelief, luſting, and abuſing them, is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to diſcourage the Churches that have them now from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving. Men being led through the ſight of Gods Grace in the Death of Chriſt to truſt in him, they fear not wrath, but rejoyce in mercy, and in the hope of the glory to be revealed upon them. They ſee that in it for them, that (contrary to his reaſonings) drawes them to believe whatever others do that liſten more to their reaſons, then
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:117749:172"/>to God in it. <hi>Caleb</hi> ſaw enough in Gods Preſence to comfort them againſt diſcouragements from the ſtrongeſt of enemies, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that (yea, with never the leſs confidence becauſe) many amongſt whom he walked, were (for not truſting in it) conſumed by it. But he ſays, <q>
                        <hi>A ſoul may object. Oh, but Chriſt is not a propitiation for all ſins.</hi>
                     </q> To which we can tell him, yes, except that ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt. He hath ſo far obtained redemption for all other, that he can forgive them, yea will that his goodneſs and fulneſs of redemption prevailing with them to ſubmit to him. And in waiting on him in his Goſpel we can tell them too, that he will quicken them powerfully, bring them out of their priſon doors, take them in, &amp;c. In hearing they ſhall live. So that all that objection is but frothy.</p>
                  <p n="2">

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It conjoyns them both as to believers (the parties ſpoken of) moſt firmly. We declare that whatever Chriſt hath impetrated thats ſpecially good, he hath impetrated it to be conferred upon the believers, and ſealed the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made with them for ever. So that his after-reaſoning there is vain, and indeed he leaves it as pertaining to the believer (the thing propounded) and applies the caſe to an unbelieving ſinner. <q>2. <hi>He ſays, We divide the Oblation and Interceſſion, and that makes againſt the believers conſolation.</hi>
                     </q> 
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is vain too, for we ſay, both theſe pertain to the believer. He ever lives to make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for thoſe that come to God by him. Sure Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> hath been a prevaricator, and did it ſo exactly, that he hath not forgot to do it yet. Theſe two Conſiderations might rather make againſt unbelievers continuing ſuch, concerning whom we ſay, That Chriſt makes not ſo ſpecial Interceſſion as for others. And that to them that fulneſs in Chriſt ſhall not be applied or communicated. But this is beſide the buſineſs, <hi>Amphoram inſtituit &amp; urceus exit.</hi> We af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, and ſtrongly maintain them both as to believers; to which we alſo apply thoſe two places cited by him, <hi>viz. Rom.</hi> 8.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>2.33, 34 and 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.2. And yet in both places, I conceive he ſtrengthens their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, from conſidering the general, as I have before noted. <hi>If he gave his Son up for us All, how ſhall he not with him give us</hi> (us the Elect of God, the Called according to purpoſe) <hi>all things.</hi> Is he ſo
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:117749:173"/>good to all? how ſpecially good to us then that are made his friends and children? But we deny, that thoſe further things (as there ſpoken of at leaſt) are attributable to all that Chriſt died for, one and other, but onely to believers. 3. He ſays, <q>
                        <hi>Our denying the procurement of Faith, Grace, Holineſs, the whole intendment of the New Coverant, cuts the nerves of believers conſolation.</hi>
                     </q> We deny not that he obliged his Father upon his Covenant, to glorifie him, and bring in people to him according to his own good will. But ſuppoſe we wholly denied it, what is this againſt the conſolation of believers that have faith already given them: we granting and firmly holding it, that he is to waſh, ſanctifie, lead &amp; guide them by his Spirit, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede for them for their perſeverance unto glory, and to mediate for them the performance of the new Covenant. Such ſorry miſtakes I ſometime hear out of Pulpits, in which men meerly miſtake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſlander us. His Queries are all impertinent, and to no purpoſe: his Concluſions untrue, and againſt the comfort that this Doctrine affordeth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the third place, he endeavours to ſhew that their Doctrine "<hi>hinders not the conſolation of Believers.</hi> To that I ſay, That he dyed for Believers, hinders not their conſolation that know themſelves to be Believers: but that that he dyed for ſuch onely, doth them no good, it being contrary to the Scriptures, and taking from them that Goſpel that they ſhould preach to others: and alſo that motive that ſhould lead them out to Charity toward All, and to exhort them to prize and live to Chriſt; they not knowing to whom theſe things appertain, or not knowing at leaſt the Goſpel-ground for them. I ſay alſo that it hinders men that yet believe not, from ſeeing that Chriſt dyed for them, and ſo from believing in him. He ſays, "<hi>Many experiment the contrary.</hi> To which I ſay but this, That I have not yet met with any that I could perceive to be ſuch, or to prove themſelves ſuch by the limiting of the Death of Chriſt. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed God may &amp; ſometimes doth work by indefinite propoſitions, as That he dyed for ſinners, for the unjuſt, ungodly &amp;c. theſe ſayings being his own, and the ſubjects of them in themſelves being of equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent extent with Univerſals; ſo that though they do not actually lead out their conceptions and thoughts to the Univerſall extent, yet indeed virtually they do, while the Soul is drawn in by conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Death as propounded to, or affirmed of men as under ſuch a condition as is univerſall. For his reaſoning, <q>
                        <hi>Chriſt dyed for Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:117749:173"/>I am ſuch a one, therefore for me;</hi>
                     </q> though the Major is true, yet the Minor cannot well be affirmed of thoſe that know not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe before, that Chriſt dyed for them (and if they do this <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> is needleſſe to them) for what Faith hath a man before he believe that Chriſt dyed for him, by which he may know and believe that Chriſt dyed for him? not a faith that worketh by love, becauſe that ſprings from an apprehenſion of Gods love, for we cannot love him but as we behold him loving us firſt. Not a Faith by grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe while men doubt or know not that Chriſt dyed for them, they know not the grace that the Goſpel holds forth to move them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving; ſeeing according to the Goſpel-Declaration all grace runs by and through Chriſts mediation. And if not ſuch a Faith then the Major and Minor agree not; for they will not ſay that Chriſt dyed for All that have a dead Faith, or conceits of faith wrought by ſelf-endeavor, ſeeing men may have thoſe &amp; yet periſh. So that this argument hath in it a great deal of deceit, and puts men upon many inconveniencies to prove the Minor, upon which all the grounds of their comfort ſtand. For upon that act of their faith, Chriſt himſelf with all his death and mediation is laid, that being the foundation they lay him upon, whereas thoſe things as aſſerted in the word, for them, &amp; credited by them, ſhould lay faith upon him, &amp; ſo themſelves alſo upon him by faith. Whereas he ſays <q>
                        <hi>that a better ſyllogiſme then this, He dyed for All men: I am a man,</hi> ergo, <hi>for me;</hi>
                     </q> I deny it: For</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This is a more immediate Divine Faith, as ſpringing from, and being bottomed upon the Word of God, as hath been ſeen. 2. The Minor is more conſpicuous and evident. 3. The grace of God is more admired, to ſee that he dyed for me while yet I am as other men, a ſinner, then when by my induſtry I think I am framed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; for then I look upon his love through ſomething found in me, in which I differ from others, which lifts me up above others, looking upon them as not ſo framed, but the other abaſes and leads to love and pity others, even ſinners, that are as I. But oh the pride and vanity of mans heart, that prefers ſuch conſolations as take in ſomething of the creatures frames with them, before thoſe that have nothing but God to a naked creature to ſpring up all his frames from pure love without him! How many are the endeavours and ſtrifts of men again and again to make out this propoſition, I am a Believer, while in the mean time they reject and believe not that love of God to them as men and ſinners, that ſhould indeed in the
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:117749:174"/>receit of it and the Spirits ſetting it home, make them believers, and ſpring up all thoſe frames which they as it were by works of the Law endeavour after (and cannot that way attain) that they might evidence themſelves to be believers, and when they think they have by much ſtrift attained to believe, then thoſe their ſtrifts, their faith as they ſuppoſe with all the ſigns that they have annexed to it, are taken in together as the ground of their comfort and hope in God; yea, of their belief that Chriſt was ſent and dyed for them, which yet they are at a loſſe in, queſtioning Gods love to them and their ground and cauſe of hoping in him, as they ſee cauſe to queſtion their own love to, and ſo by conſequence their own faith in him. A miſerable way it is (God knows) that this Doctrine leads multitudes into, while they either curiouſly pry into Gods ſecrets, almoſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction, or elſe look into themſelves for fruits of faith, that may evidence them to have faith and ſo their Election, and ſo right to Chriſt and his Goſpel, and all this before they can ſee that there is any thing in the Goſpel that is good news to them, or any love in God towards them that works that Faith and thoſe Fruits in its appearance, by which their Election ſhould be diſcerned by them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The fourth thing he leaves, onely deſiring the Reader to peruſe that place of <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32, 33, 34. which I alſo commend to the Reader, that upon good grounds knowes himſelf a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, one in Chriſt, walking after the Spirit, and not after the fleſh; for to ſuch it is written, and to their conſolation, <hi>ver.</hi> 1.28, 29, 30, &amp;c. and I ſay to ſuch its a <q>
                        <hi>rich Mine of firm, laſting comfort, conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, joy, aſſurance, reſt, peace, refreſhment and ſatisfaction;</hi>
                     </q> no place fuller or ſweeter that I know of, and all ſpringing from the conſideration of God as their friend and Father, juſtifying them, Chriſt that dyed for them and roſe again now interceding at Gods right hand for them, that they may be one with Chriſt in priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and glory, and have the <hi>New Covenant</hi> fully performed to them. But if the Reader that believes deſires to perſwade others to faith: or if he be one that knows not whether God hath any good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will to him or no, and ſo is not yet by faith in Chriſt, that place will afford little to him. But I deſire him to read 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4, 5, 6. <hi>that God wils All to be ſaved, and come to the knowledge of the truth, That there is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the man Chriſt Jeſus, who gave himſelf a Ranſome for All, &amp;c.</hi> And if he believe that record of God, that teſtimony born to him and his
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:117749:174"/>Son, he may therein ſee Gods good-will to him and good ground for him to ſeek him through Chriſt that gave himſelf a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome for him, good cauſe to Repent of all his evils againſt him, that is ſo well affected toward him; good cauſe to leave his evill wayes of grieving him, and live to him, and love him that is ſo loving to him; good cauſe to hope in his mercy, and in that hope to call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and ſeek to enjoy more knowledge of him and experience of his ſalvation, and good matter to hold forth to others for their converſion and bringing in to Chriſt. None of all which their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictive Doctrine (which is Anti-Chriſtian as it hinders the courſe of the Goſpel of Chriſt, and keeps men in ignorance of the grounds they have to repent, ſeek after, love and hope in God, and not at all held forth in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32.) can lead them to; for by it none who yet believeth not, and ſo knoweth not himſelf to be Elected, can ſee any ground to believe in, live to, love, pleaſe or ſerve God, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as for ought he knowes he is from eternity an enemy to him, and hates him; but it will lead him to go on reſolutely in his way, and do what ſeems good to him, ſeeing by that its undeniably true that if Chriſt dyed for him he cannot miſcarry, if otherwiſe, he muſt, doe what he can, as hath been noted; But let him that yet doubts of Gods love to him reject that deviſed Doctrine that contradicts the Scriptures, and letting alone the ſecrets of God (which pertain not to him yet to know, nor ſhall hurt him if he attend and yield up to that that is revealed, yea, ſhall be alſo profitably revealed to him if he ſubmit to what is revealed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.14.) let him I ſay mind the record of God that he hath given of his Son, that he hath given himſelf a Ranſom for All, yea, and that God hath given us eternal life (even us whom he commands to believe in the name of his Son 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.23.) and this life is in his Son, <hi>he that hath the Son hath life, &amp; he that hath not the Son hath not life;</hi> thence ſhall he ſee both ground to believe that God hath given him eternall life, and put it into Chriſt, and alſo both neceſſity and incouragement to believe on Chriſt, that in believing he may have that life, even that eternall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of God in Chriſt, that will for ever ſatisfie him and make him happy.</p>
